# Get started with direct mail deliveries {#gs-direct-mail}

Direct mail is an offline channel that allows you to produce files to mass deliver personalized letters to your customers such as postcards, flyers, or catalogs.

When creating a direct mail delivery, Adobe Campaign automatically generates an extraction file containing all the targeted profiles and selected data, such as postal addresses and profile attributes. This file is sent to the server of your choice so that it is accessible by your chosen direct mail provider, who will handle the actual mailing process for you.

To create direct mail deliveries, you have three options:

* **Workflows**: After adding a Direct mail channel activity to your workflow and configuring the basic settings, you can then craft the content of your direct mail deliveries from your right pane menu. For detailed instructions on how to configure workflow, refer to [this page](../workflows/gs-workflow-creation.md).
* **Campaigns**: Once you have created a campaign, you can create a direct mail delivery. For more information on setting up your campaign, refer to [this page](../campaigns/gs-campaigns.md).
* **Stand-alone deliveries**: Engage customers directly and instantly with individual direct mail delivery, without the need for workflows or campaigns. [Learn how to create a delivery](../msg/gs-deliveries.md)
