Get Started with campaigns
Adobe Campaign offers a set of solutions that help you personalize and deliver campaigns across all of your online and offline channels. You can create, configure, execute and analyze marketing campaigns. All marketing campaigns can be managed from a unified control center. Discover how to browse and create marketing campaigns in this section.

Campaigns include actions (deliveries) and processes (importing or extracting files), as well as resources (marketing documents, delivery outlines). They are used in marketing campaigns. Campaigns are part of a program, and programs are included in a campaign plan.

## Access and manage your campaigns{#access-campaigns}

To create a new campaign or manage your existing campaigns, click the **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]** menu. Two tabs are available:

* The **Browse** tab lists all existing campaigns. You can click a campaign to open its dashboard or create a new campaign by clicking the **Create campaign** button. See this [section](create-campaigns.md#create-campaigns) 

* The **Templates** tab lists all available campaign templates. Campaign templates are pre-configued so that they can be reused for creating new campaigns. They are created from the client console. [Read more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/automation/campaign-orchestration/marketing-campaign-templates.html).

You can customize the displayed columns by clicking the **Configure column for a custom layout** icon located in the upper-right corner of the list. This allows you to add additional information to the list. In addition, a search bar and filters are available to facilitate easy searching within the list. [Learn more](../get-started/user-interface.md#list-screens)

For example, you can filter on your campaign schedule. Open the filters panel and use the **Start - End Date** section:

The **Configure campaign settings** icon allows you to modify the campaign's properties that were defined when creating the campaign. See this [section](create-campaigns.md#create-campaigns)
