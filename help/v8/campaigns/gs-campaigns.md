Adobe Campaign allows you to easily orchestrate your targeted marketing initiatives, using the built-in campaign management capability. With the ability to define a schedule, you can plan the duration and timing of your campaigns to align with strategic objectives and maximize audience engagement.

By adding multiple workflows and deliveries specific to the campaign, you can create personalized experiences across various channels, ensuring that each touchpoint resonates with the intended audience.

Campaigns offer dedicated reporting metrics to gain comprehensive insights into the performance of your entire campaign, enabling you to assess its effectiveness, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize future efforts. Discover how to access and understand campaign reports in [this section](../reporting/campaign-reports.md).
