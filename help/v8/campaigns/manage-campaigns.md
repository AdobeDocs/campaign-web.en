# Access and manage your campaigns{#manage-campaigns}

To create a new campaign or manage your existing campaigns, click the **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]** menu. 

## The campaign list{#access-campaigns}

In the campaign list, two tabs are available:

![Campaign list](assets/campaign-list.png)

* The **Browse** tab lists all existing campaigns. You can click a campaign to open its dashboard or create a new campaign by clicking the **Create campaign** button. See this [section](create-campaigns.md#create-campaigns).

* The **Templates** tab lists all available campaign templates. Campaign templates are pre-configured so that they can be reused when creating new campaigns. They are created from the client console.

Each campaign in the list displays information about its current status, creation date, the last time it was modified, etc.

You can customize the displayed columns by clicking the **Configure column for a custom layout** icon located in the upper-right corner of the list. This allows you to add additional information to the list. In addition, a search bar and filters are available to facilitate easy searching within the list. [Learn more](../get-started/user-interface.md#list-screens)

For example, you can filter on your campaign schedule. Open the filter panel and use the **Start - End Date** section:

The status and schedule of the campaign is displayed at the top of the screen. You can use the **Configure campaign settings** icon to modify the campaign's properties that were defined when creating the campaign. Three buttons are available that allow you to view logs, reporting, duplicate or delete the campaign. See this [section](create-campaigns.md#create-campaigns) 

Two tabs are available:

* The **Workflows** tab lists all workflows linked to the campaign. This tab also allows you to create a new workflow inside the campaign. See this [section](create-campaigns.md#create-campaigns) 

* The **Deliveries** tab lists all deliveries linked to the campaign. You can also create a new delivery inside the campaign. See this [section](create-campaigns.md#create-campaigns) 

## Duplicate and delete a campaign

You can duplicate or delete a campaign:

* from the list of campaigns, click the ellipsis button then select **Duplicate** or **Delete**.
* from the campaign itself, click the **More** button then select **Duplicate** or **Delete**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The **Deliveries** tab displays all deliveries linked to the campaign. However, deliveries created in a workflow cannot be deleted from there. To delete a delivery created in the context of a workflow, you must delete the delivery activity from the workflow.
