## Add personalization {#personalization}

Messages delivered by Adobe Campaign can be personalized in various ways. [Learn more about personalization capabilities](../personalization/gs-personalization.md).

Use Campaign to create dynamic content and send personalized messages. Personalization capabilities can be combined to improve your messages and create a custom user experience.

You can personalize the message content by:

* Inserting dynamic **personalization fields**

    Personalization fields are used for first-level personalization of your messages. You can select any field available in the database from the personalization editor. For a delivery, you can select any field related to the recipient, the message or the delivery. These personalization attributes can be inserted in the subject line or the body of your messages. [Learn more](../personalization/personalize.md)
    
* Inserting pre-defined **expression fragments**
    
    Campaign comes with a set of expression fragments which contain a specific rendering that you can insert into your deliveries. For example, you can add a logo, a greeting message, or a link to the mirror page of the message. expression fragments are available from a dedicated entry un the personalization editor. In addition, you can also create your own expression fragments to suit your needs. [Learn how to use expression fragments](../content/use-expression-fragments.md)

* Create **conditional content**

    Configure conditional content to add dynamic personalization based on the recipient's profile for example. Text blocks and/or images are inserted when a particular condition is true. [Learn more](../personalization/conditions.md)

* Add **personalized offers**
    
    Insert personalized offers in your message content, depending on the recipient location, the current weather, or the last purchase order. [Learn more](../msg/offers.md)

## Preview and test your deliveries

Once your message content has been defined, you can preview it to control the rendering of your messages, and check personalization settings with test profiles. [Learn more](../preview-test/preview-test.md)

## Schedule the delivery sending {#gs-schedule}

>id="acw_deliveries_email_schedule"
>title="Set a contact date and time"
>abstract="Define the date and the exact time for sending your delivery. By choosing the most appropriate time for your marketing message, you can maximise open rates."

You can set the date and the exact time for sending your messages. By choosing the most appropriate time for your marketing message, you can maximise open rates.

To schedule the sending of the a delivery, open your delivery and browse to the **[!UICONTROL Schedule]** section. Use the **[!UICONTROL Enable scheduling]** toggle to activate it, and set the desired date and time for sending. Once you send the delivery, the actual sending will start on the contact date you have defined.

![](assets/schedule.png){zoomable="yes"}

By default, the **[!UICONTROL Enable confirmation before sending]** option is enabled. This option requires you to confirm the sending before the delivery is sent at the scheduled date and time. If you need to send the delivery automatically on the scheduled date and time, you can disable this option.

Learn steps to send a scheduled delivery in [this section](../monitor/prepare-send.md#schedule-the-send).

## Monitoring and tracking logs {#gs-tracking-logs}

Monitoring your deliveries after they have been sent is a key step to ensure your maketing campaigns are efficient and reach out to your customers. 

You can monitor after sending a delivery, as well as understand how delivery failures and quarantines are managed.

Learn more about monitoring and tracking capabilities in [this section](../reporting/gs-reports.md).
