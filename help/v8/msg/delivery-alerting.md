# Get started with delivery alerting {#gs-delivery-alerting}

The Delivery alerting feature is an alert management system that enables a group of users to automatically receive email notifications containing information on the execution of their deliveries. The recipients of the alerts can monitor the deliveries that are being processed by Adobe Campaign and take appropriate actions when there are issues in their execution.

These alerting notifications can be customized depending on specific alerting criteria that are defined through a dashboard in the Adobe Campaign interface.

The email notifications received by users contain:
* A **Summary** displaying the number of deliveries meeting the criteria that you defined and the label/color that you chose for each criterion.
* A **Details** section listing all of the delivery criteria defined for the corresponding dashboard and all of the deliveries for each criterion.

To help you set up these alerts, Campaign Web User Interface allows you to create:

* **Delivery alerting dashboards**: These dashboards let you specify who will receive the alerts, configure alerting criteria, and access the history of all sent notifications.
* **Delivery alerting criteria**:

Let's say you want to inform the users with administration rights of the failed deliveries only. However, you want the marketing users to receive information on the deliveries with a soft bounce bad error ratio. Therefore, you need to create two different dashboards and define the criteria that you want for each group of recipients.
