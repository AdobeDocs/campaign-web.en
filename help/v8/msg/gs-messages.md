# Get started with messages{#gs-messages}

With Adobe Campaign, you can send cross-channel campaigns including emails, SMS, and Push notifications, and measure their impact using various dedicated reports. 

These messages are designed and sent though deliveries, and can be personalized for each recipient. These deliveries can be standalone, or included in workflows, in the context of a marketing campaign. Learn how to create and manage deliveries in Adobe Campaign in [this section](gs-deliveries.md).

Adobe Campaign v8 comes with the following delivery channels: Email, SMS, Push notification, and Direct mail. Other channels such as In-App messaging, or Social Marketing with X (Twitter) are not yet supported.

Browse the sections below to learn how to create and send messages.
