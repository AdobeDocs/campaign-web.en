## Out-of-the-box alerting criteria {#ootb-criteria}

Pre-defined alerting criteria are available in Campaign Web User Interface. They are accessible from the **Delivery Alerting** menu in the left navigation pane.

You can add any of them into your delivery alerting dashboard. You can also create your own criteria to suit your needs.

* **Deliveries failed**: Any delivery scheduled within a defined range, with an erroneous status.
* **Deliveries with preparation failed**: Any delivery modified within a defined range, for which the preparation step (target calculation and content generation) has failed. 
* **Delivery with bad error ratio for soft bounces**: Any delivery scheduled within a defined range, with a status at least In progress, with a soft bounce error ratio greater than a defined percentage.
* **Delivery with bad error ratio for hard bounces**: Any delivery scheduled within a defined range, with a status at least In progress, with a hard bounce error ratio greater than a defined percentage.
* **Deliveries with long start pending**: Any delivery scheduled within a defined range, with a Start pending status for longer than a defined duration, Start pending status meaning that the messages have not been taken into account by the system yet.
* **Deliveries with low throughput**: Any delivery started for longer than a defined duration, with less than a defined percentage of processed messages, with a throughput lower than a defined value.
* **Deliveries in progress**: Any delivery scheduled within a defined range, with the In progress status.

>[!NOTE]

>All the parameters applying to the above criteria have defaults values. These values can be changed in the Criteria parameters sections of the delivery alerting dashboards where they are being used.

To create a new criterion, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Delivery Ã€lerting** menu in the left navigation pane then select the **Criteria** tab.
1. Click the **Create delivery alerting criteria** button.
1. Provide a label for the criterion. The internal name is automatically populated and is read-only.
1. The **Delivery filter applied by this criteria** allows you to refine the scope of the criterion by applying a predefined filter to it.

    In the example below, the **Deliveries in progress (critInProgressDeliveries)** filter has been selected, meaning that the criterion only takes into account deliveries with the "In progress" status.

    If none of the predefined filters suit your needs, you can reach out to your administrator in order to create your own filter. This operation must be performed by advanced users in the Campaign console.

1. In the **Indicators to add in alerts** section, choose the indicators to show in the email alerts. Those indicators will display as columns in the "Details" section of the alerts.

1.  Specify the **Alert Type** for the criterion, meaning the label and color to display next to the delivery criterion in the "Summary" section of the alerts.

1. The **Criteria Frequency** section allows you to manage the frequency at which alerts will be sent per day for a given delivery.

    * **This delivery criterion will be repeated in every notification**: Deliveries which meet the criterion will be displayed in every email alert of the day.
    * **This delivery criterion is sent only on the first occurence of the day**: Deliveries which meet the criterion will be displayed in the first report of the day only. They will not be repeated in every email alert.
