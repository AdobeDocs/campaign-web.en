# Get started with custom external channels {#gs-custom-channel}

You can, directly from Adobe Campaign Web UI, orchestrate and execute deliveries based on custom external channels integrated with third-parties. The creation of the custom external channel is performed in the Client Console.

You can configure custom channel external deliveries in workflows or as standalone deliveries, define your audience, and generate customizable export files with all necessary contact and personalization data.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Reporting is not available in the Web UI for custom channel external deliveries. You must browse to the Client Console to access reports.

The steps below detail the procedure for a standalone (one-shot) delivery. Most steps are similar to call center deliveries. For more details, refer to this [page](../call-center/create-call-center.md).

To create and send a new standalone custom external delivery, follow these main steps:

1. Create the custom external channel, [read more](#create-channel)
1. Create the delivery, [read more](#create-delivery)
1. Define the audience, [read more](#select-audience)
1. Edit the content, [read more](#edit-content)
1. Preview and send the delivery, [read more](#preview-send)

First, you need to configure the custom external channel. Here are the main steps to perform in the Client Console:
