You can, directly from Adobe Campaign Web UI, orchestrate and execute deliveries based on custom external channels integrated with third-parties. The creation of the custom external channel is performed in the Client Console.

You can configure custom channel external deliveries in workflows or as standalone deliveries, define your audience, and generate customizable export files with all necessary contact and personalization data.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Reporting is not available in the Web UI for custom channel external deliveries. You must browse to the Client Console to access reports.

You can use the custom channel channel in one of the following ways:

* **Workflows**: add a custom channel activity to your workflow and configure the basic settings and content. For detailed instructions on configuring workflows, refer to [this page](../workflows/gs-workflow-creation.md).
* **Campaigns**: Once you create a campaign, you can add a custom channel delivery. For more information on setting up campaigns, refer to [this page](../campaigns/gs-campaigns.md).
* **Stand-alone deliveries**: create a one-time custom channel delivery, without the need for workflows or campaigns. [Learn how to create a delivery](../msg/gs-deliveries.md)
