You can, directly from Adobe Campaign Web UI, orchestrate and execute deliveries based on custom channels integrated with third-parties. The configuration of the custom channel is performed in the Client Console.

Two types of custom channels are supported, external and API. With external channels, Campaign generates customizable export files with all necessary contact and personalization data. With API channels, messages are sent to the target profiles via the API configured.

You can add custom channel deliveries in workflows or just use them as standalone deliveries.

The steps below detail the procedure for a standalone (one-shot) delivery. Most steps are similar to call center deliveries. For more details, refer to this [page](../call-center/create-call-center.md).

To send a new standalone custom delivery, follow these main steps:

1. Configure the custom channel, [read more](#create-channel)
1. Create the delivery, [read more](#create-delivery)
1. Define the audience, [read more](#select-audience)
1. Edit the content, [read more](#edit-content)
1. Preview and send the delivery, [read more](#preview-send)

## Configure the custom channel{#create-channel}

First, you need to configure the custom channel. Here are the main steps to perform in the Client Console. These steps are common to custom external and API channels:

1. Configure the schema to add the new channel to the list of available channels. [Read more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/send/custom-channel.html#configure-schema){target="_blank"}
1. Create a new routing external account. [Read more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/send/custom-channel.html#reate-ext-account){target="_blank"}
1. Create a new delivery template associated to the new channel. [Read more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/send/custom-channel.html#create-template){target="_blank"}
