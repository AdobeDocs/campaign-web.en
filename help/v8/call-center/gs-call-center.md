The call center channel lets you export targeted contact lists for outbound phone campaigns directly from Adobe Campaign Web UI. Use it to coordinate calls through internal teams or external contact centers.

You can configure call deliveries in workflows or as standalone deliveries, define your audience, and generate customizable export files with all necessary contact and personalization data.

This channel is ideal for lead follow-ups, retention calls, or service outreach, and helps extend your omnichannel strategy with personalized voice interactions.

You can use the call center channel in one of the following ways:

* **Workflows**: add a call center activity to your workflow and configure the basic settings and content. For detailed instructions on configuring workflows, refer to [this page](../workflows/gs-workflow-creation.md).
* **Campaigns**: Once you create a campaign, you can add a call center delivery. For more information on setting up campaigns, refer to [this page](../campaigns/gs-campaigns.md).
* **Stand-alone deliveries**: create a one-time call center delivery, without the need for workflows or campaigns. [Learn how to create a delivery](../msg/gs-deliveries.md)
