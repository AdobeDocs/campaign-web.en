## Preview and send the delivery{#preview-send}

When the delivery content is ready, you can preview it using test profiles and send proofs. You can then send the direct mail delivery to generate the extraction file.

The main steps to preview and send your extraction file are as follows. More details are available in [this page](./direct-mail/send-direct-mail.md).

1. From your delivery content page, use **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** to preview your personalized content and send proofs. [Read more](./direct-mail/send-direct-mail.md#preview-dm)

    ![Screenshot showing the simulate content option in the delivery content page](assets/cc-simulate.png){zoomable="yes"}

Once your delivery is sent, the extraction file is automatically generated and exported to the location specified in the **[!UICONTROL Routing]** external account selected in the delivery template's [advanced settings](../advanced-settings/delivery-settings.md).
