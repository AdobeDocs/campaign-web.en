The steps to define the content of your email are as follows:

1. Check the **[!UICONTROL From name]** and **[!UICONTROL From email]** information. These fields are read-only, they are configured in the email template selected when creating the email.

1. Define the email **[!UICONTROL Subject line]**. To do this, open the Expression Editor to define its content and add personalization using various attributes and content blocks or offers. [Learn how to personalize content](../personalization/personalize.md)

1. If you want to send offers with your email, select them using the **[!UICONTROL Offers]** button. You will then be able to insert them into the email using personalization fields. [Learn how to send offers into emails](offers.md)

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Email Designer]** button to structure and design the content of the email. Learn how to design emails

1. If you want to attach a file to the email, click the **[!UICONTROL Add attachment]** button then select one or multiple file(s).

Once the content of your email has been defined, use the **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** button to check how it will display before sending it. [Learn how to preview and test your email](../preview-test/preview-test.md)
