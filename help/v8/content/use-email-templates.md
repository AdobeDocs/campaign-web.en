# Use email content templates {#use-email-templates}

When [creating an email](../email/create-email.md), use the **[!UICONTROL Select design template]** section of the **[!UICONTROL Create your email]** interface to start building your content from a template.

You can choose from:

* **Sample templates**. Campaign comes with a set of built-in templates that you can choose from.

* **Saved templates**. You can also use a custom template that you saved as a template from existing content.

Learn how to use templates and how to save email content as a template in the sections below.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Email content templates are different from [delivery templates](../msg/delivery-template.md). They allow you to reuse only email content, whereas delivery templates allow you to reuse delivery content and all the delivery settings and properties, such as typologies, sender address, and audiences.

To start building your content with one of the sample or saved templates, follow the steps below.

1. Open the [Email Designer](../email/create-email-content.md).

1. On the **[!UICONTROL Create your email]** screen, the **[!UICONTROL Sample templates]** tab is selected by default.

1. To use an existing custom template, browse to the **[!UICONTROL Saved templates]** tab.

1. The list of all [saved templates](create-email-templates.md#save-as-template) displays. You can sort them **[!UICONTROL By name]**, **[!UICONTROL Last modified]**, and **[!UICONTROL Last created]**.
