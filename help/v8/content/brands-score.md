The Brand Alignment feature is built to help you create, review, and manage content that stays true to your brand guidelines. It ensures consistency in tone, messaging, and visual identity across your email campaigns, while also serving as a quality check before your content goes live.

## Validate your content with brand alignment {#validate-content}

Once [your brand is set up and published](brands.md), assess your brand alignment score directly within your email campaign to ensure your content aligns with your brand guidelines:

1. Create your [email campaign](../email/create-email.md).

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Brand Alignment]** menu in the email designer.
    
    Your content will automatically be evaluated against your default brand. [Learn how to assign a default brand](brands.md).
