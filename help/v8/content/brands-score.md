The content review feature provides comprehensive evaluation tools to measure how well your campaigns align with your brand guidelines and maintain content quality standards across all communications:

* **Brand Alignment**: Review, and manage content that stays true to your brand guidelines. This ensures consistency in tone, messaging, and visual identity across your email campaigns.
* **Quality Check**: Validate your content before it goes live to maintain high standards and brand integrity.

## Validate your content with brand alignment {#validate-content}
