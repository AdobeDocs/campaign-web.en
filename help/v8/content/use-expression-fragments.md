Expression fragments can be leveraged in any field that can be edited using the expression editor. To add expression fragments to your content, follow the steps below.

1. Open the [Expression editor](../personalization/gs-personalization.md) and select the **[!UICONTROL Fragments]** menu in the left pane.

    The list displays all the expression fragments that have been created on the current sandbox.

1. Click the `+` icon next to an expression fragment to add it into your content.

1. The fragment ID is added into the editor. If you open the corresponding expression fragment and edit it from the interface, the changes are synchronized. They are automatically propagated to all **[!UICONTROL Draft]** deliveries containing that fragment ID.
