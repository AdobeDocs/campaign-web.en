You can choose from:

* **Sample templates**. Campaign comes with a set of built-in templates that you can choose from.

* **Saved templates**. You can also use a custom template that you either created from scratch, duplicated, or saved as template from an existing content. [Learn more](delivery-template.md)

To start building your content with one of the sample or saved templates, follow the steps below.

1. Open the [email designer](create-email-content.md).

1. On the **[!UICONTROL Create your email]** screen, the **[!UICONTROL Sample templates]** tab is selected by default.
