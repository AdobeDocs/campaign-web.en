When you access the email content, use the **[!UICONTROL Select design template]** section of the interface to start building your content from a template.

Campaign comes with a set of built-in templates, available in the **Sample templates** tab. You can add your own templates and use them to build your email content. Custom templates are stored in the **Saved templates** tab. Learn how to save an email as a template and how to use it in the sections below.
