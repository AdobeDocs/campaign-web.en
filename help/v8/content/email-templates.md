# Work with email templates {#email-content-templates}

When [creating an email](#create-email), use the **[!UICONTROL Select design template]** section of the **[!UICONTROL Create your email]** interface to start building your content from a template.

You can choose from:

* **Sample templates**. Campaign comes with a set of built-in templates that you can choose from.

* **Saved templates**. You can also use a custom template that you saved as template from an existing content.

Learn how to use templates and how to save an email content as a template in the sections below.

## Use a template {#use-templates}

To start building your content with one of the sample or saved templates, follow the steps below.

1. Open the [email designer](create-email-content.md).

1. On the **[!UICONTROL Create your email]** screen, the **[!UICONTROL Sample templates]** tab is selected by default.

1. To use an existing custom template, browse to the **[!UICONTROL Saved templates]** tab.
