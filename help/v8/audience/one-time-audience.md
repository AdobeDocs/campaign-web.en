# Build a one-time audience for delivery {#sone-time}

This section describes how to build a audience when designing a new delivery. In this case, the audience is targeted by building a query in the rule builder to target the desired recipients. The audience is only used once in this email. It is not saved in the audiences list.

When defining the main target of a delivery, you can also:

* [Select an existing audience](add-audience.md) from the **[!UICONTROL Audiences]** list.
* [Load an audience from an external file](file-audience.md) (for emails only).

To create a new audience when designing an email, follow these steps: 

1. From the **Audience** section of the delivery creation assistant, click the **[!UICONTROL Select audience]** button.

1. Select **Create your own**. The rule builder is displayed. It allows you to define the population targeted by your delivery by filtering data contained in the database. [Learn how to use the rule builder](segment-builder.md)
