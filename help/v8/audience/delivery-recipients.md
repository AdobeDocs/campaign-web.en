# Select delivery recipients {#add-audience}
 
To define the recipients of a delivery, you can:

* [Select an existing audience](add-audience.md) created in Adobe Campaign client console or Web User Interface, or coming from Adobe Experience Platform,
* [Build a one-time audience](one-time-audience.md) to use once for this specific delivery. This is done by defining and combining filtering criteria in the query modeler,
* [Load an audience from an external file](file-audience.md). This option is available for standalone email deliveries only.

When targeting an audience, you can also define **control groups** to avoid sending messages to a portion of your audience, and measure the impact of your campaigns. [Learn how to set a control group](control-group.md)
