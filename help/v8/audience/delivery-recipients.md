# Select delivery recipients {#add-audience}

To define the recipients of a delivery, you can:

* [Select an existing audience](add-audience.md) created in Adobe Campaign client console or Web User Interface, or originating from Adobe Experience Platform.
* [Build a one-time audience](one-time-audience.md) to use once for this specific delivery. Define and combine filtering criteria in the query modeler.
* [Load an audience from an external file](file-audience.md). This option applies to standalone email deliveries only.

When targeting an audience, define **control groups** to avoid sending messages to a portion of your audience and measure the impact of your campaigns. [Learn how to set a control group](control-group.md)
