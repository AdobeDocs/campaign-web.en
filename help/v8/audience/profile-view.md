To access the details of a profile, browse to **[!UICONTROL Customer management]** > **[!UICONTROL Profiles]**, then click on the profile you want to access.

Information on the profile is organized as follows:

* The **[!UICONTROL Details]** tab allows you to browse through the profile's built-in and custom attributes. To edit an attribute, make changes in the desired field, and click the **[!UICONTROL Save]** button. Detailed information on profiles' attributes is available in the [Create a profile](create-profile.md) section.
