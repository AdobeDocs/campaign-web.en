A recipient is a profile which is targeted to receive messages sent by Adobe Campaign. In Adobe Campaign, recipients are the default profiles targeted for sending deliveries (emails, SMS, etc.). Recipient data stored in the database enable you create audiences that will receive any given delivery, and to add personalization data in your delivery contents. Other types of profiles are stored in the database. They are designed for different uses: for example, seed profiles are made to test your deliveries before they are sent to the final audience.

Recipients can only be added from Campaign client console. However, they are visible in Campaign web, from the **Recipients** entry of the left navigation rail.

To edit the recipient's data, click the three dots next to its name and choose **Edit...**.
