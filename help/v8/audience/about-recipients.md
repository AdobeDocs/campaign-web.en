## What is a profile? {#what} 

A profile in Adobe Campaign Web is an individual stored in the database, serving as a key component to [create audiences](create-audience.md) for deliveries and [add personalization](../personalization/personalize.md) data to your content.

Adobe Campaign allows you to create and monitor your profiles directly from the interface. From there, you can create profiles, access a detailed view of your profiles, and edit them.

Other types of profiles are stored in the database such as **[!UICONTROL Test profiles]**, which are designed to test your deliveries before they are sent to the final audience. [Learn how to work with test profiles](test-profiles.md)

## Access the list of profiles {#access}

Profiles are accessible and editable in Adobe Campaign Web from the **[!UICONTROL Customer management]** > **Profiles** entry in the left navigation rail.

You can also access them through the **[!UICONTROL Explorer]** view, from the **[!UICONTROL Profiles & Targets]** > **[!UICONTROL Recipients]** node. From there you can browse, create and manage folders or subfolders, as well as check associated permissions. [Learn how to create folders](../get-started/permissions.md#folders)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Depending on your permissions, you might not have access to the full list of profiles stored in the database. [Learn more about permissions](../get-started/permissions.md).

You can filter the **[!UICONTROL Profiles]** list using the search field or filters available from the **Show filters** button. You can restrict the results to a specific [folder](../get-started/permissions.md#folders) using the drop-down list, or add rules using the [query modeler](../query/query-modeler-overview.md).
