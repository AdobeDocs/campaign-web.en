Campaign or AEP Audiences

query like AEP segment builder (same component with campaign data)

* import from file

show use case with a new audience creation (or import from file?)

Once your content is designed, you need to define the email's audience. This is the targer of your delivery, the profiles who will receive the email.

You have two possibilities:

* use an existing audience defined in the Adobe Campaign console.
* create a new audience that will be used for the email.
