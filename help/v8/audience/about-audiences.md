In this section, learn how to define the audience of email. The audience is the main target of your delivery: the recipients who receive the email. The type of audience depends on the target mapping defined in the delivery template. See this [section](../email/create-email.md). 

To define the audience, you can:

* Use an existing audience. [Learn more](add-audience.md)
* Create a new audience. [Learn more](segment-builder.md)
* Use an audience from an external file. [Learn more](file-audience.md)
* Use an Adobe Experience Platform audience. [Learn more](aep-audience.md)

In addition, you can define control groups to avoid sending messages to a portion of your audience, and measure the impact of your campaigns. [Learn more](control-group.md)
