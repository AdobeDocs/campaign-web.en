# Import recipients from a file {#audience-from-file}

You can add or update contacts from the delivery interface, by uploading a text file (TXT) or a comma-separated value file (CSV). They will then be added to the database.

>You can also build an import workflow to add or update multiple profiles.  


To add profiles from a local file directly from the interface, follow these steps:

1. In the delivery creation window, click the **Select audience** button and select the **Select from file** option.
1. Select the local file to upload.
1. Define the column settings and how to format data. You can skip a column using the **Ignore column** toggle.
1. Preview how data is mapped in the central section of the screen.
1. Click **Confirm** once settings are correct.

When creating and personalizing the message content, you can select fields from the input file in the Personalization editor.
