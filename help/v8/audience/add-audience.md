Here is how you select an existing audience.

1. In the delivery creation assistant,  click the **[!UICONTROL Select audience]** button then choose an existing audience.

    In this example, we want to use an existing audience targeting customers belonging to the silver and gold loyalty points levels.

1. Once your audience has been selected, you can edit the rules if necessary. You can also set a control group.
