Use Adobe Campaign to create and monitor your information services such as newsletters and to check the subscriptions/unsubscriptions to these services.

Several services can be defined in parallel, for example: specialist newsletters for certain product categories, themes or areas of a web site, subscriptions to various types of alert messages and real-time notifications.

To learn more on managing subscriptions and unsubscriptions, refer to the [Campaign v8 (client console) documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/audience/subscriptions.html){target="_blank"}.
