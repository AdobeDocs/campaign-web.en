# Get started with SMS deliveries {#sms}

SMS deliveries provide a practical and efficient way to send text messages to your customers' mobile devices. With this feature, you can create, personalize, and preview text-based messages for effective communication.

The SMS channel offers three methods for creating SMS deliveries:

* Workflows: Add an SMS activity, define basic settings, and compose your SMS content within a larger automation sequence.

* Campaigns: Incorporate SMS deliveries into dedicated campaigns, setting parameters such as target audience and delivery schedule.

* Stand-alone deliveries: Create individual SMS deliveries for quick and direct communication with your customers, without the need for workflows or campaigns.
