* **Rotate**: Switch the canvas vertically.
* **Fit to screen**: Adapt the canvas zoom level to your screen.

* **Display map**: Opens a snapshot of the canvas showing you are located.

### The Rule properties pane {#rule-properties}

On the right hand side, the **[!UICONTROL Rule properties]** pane provides information on your query. It allows you to perform various operations to check the query and ensure it suits your needs. [Learn how to check and validate your query](build-query.md#check-and-validate-your-query)
