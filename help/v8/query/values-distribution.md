# Distribution of values {#distribution-values}

The distribution of values helps to know the percentage of a value in a column within a table.

For example, among the deliveries, we want to know the distribution of values of the **Channel** column.

To get this information, go to the deliveries folder and click on **[!UICONTROL Configure columns]** button.

In the **[!UICONTROL Configure columns]** window, click on the **[!UICONTROL Information]** button of the column you want to know. Then, click on the **[!UICONTROL Distribution of values]** button.
