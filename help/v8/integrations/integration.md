# Work with Campaign and other Adobe solutions {#gs-integration}

You can connect your Campaign environment with Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and apps to combine capabilities.

Adobe Campaign comes with several connectors that allow you to communicate with external applications, connect to database engines, share and synchronize data. These connections are configured by Adobe.

Learn which solutions and apps can be connected with Campaign, and the associated use cases, in [Campaign v8 (console) documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/connect/integration.html){target="_blank"}.

In addition, with the new Campaign Web user interface, you can connect your Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service environment to achieve the following use cases:

* Manage your Adobe Experience Managed as a Cloud Service assets. [Learn more](aem-assets.md)
* Manage templates with Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. [Learn more](aem-content.md)

This connection is managed through a dedicated External Account configured in the Adobe Campaign client console.
