# Work with Campaign and other Adobe solutions {#gs-integration}

You can connect your Campaign environment with Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and applications to combine capabilities.

Adobe Campaign includes several connectors that enable communication with external applications, connection to database engines, and sharing and synchronization of data. Adobe configures these connections.

Learn which solutions and applications can be connected with Campaign, along with the associated use cases, in [Campaign v8 (console) documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/connect/integration.html){target="_blank"}.

Additionally, with the new Campaign Web user interface, you can connect your Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service environment to achieve the following use cases:

* Manage your Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service assets. [Learn more](aem-assets.md)
* Manage templates with Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. [Learn more](aem-content.md)

This connection is managed through a dedicated External Account configured in the Adobe Campaign client console.
