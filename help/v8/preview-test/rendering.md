# Test the email rendering {#rendering}


Before sending your email, make sure that your message is displayed to the recipients in an optimal way on a variety of web clients, web mails and devices.

To do this, Adobe Campaign allows you to preview the sent message in the different contexts in which it may be received and check the compatibility in major desktops and applications (webmail, message service, mobile, etc.).

>[!CAUTION]

>Using email rendering in Campaign sends a test email to a third-party system that is not under the control of Adobe. To access or delete such data, you will need to contact that third party directly. By using email rendering, you acknowledge Adobe is not responsible for any data you may send to that third-party system.

To test the email rendering, follow these steps:

1. Access the email content creation screen, then click **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]**.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Render email]** button.

    The left pane provides various desktop, mobile and web-based email clients. Select the desired email client to display a preview of your email in the right pane.
