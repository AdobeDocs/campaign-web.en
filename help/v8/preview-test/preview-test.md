Once your email content has been defined, you can use test profiles to preview and test it before sending the message.

This is an crucial step to ensure that it is accurate but also free of errors both in content and personalization settings.

To do this, [!DNL Adobe Campaign] allows you to:

* [Preview the email content and personalization](preview-content.md)
* [Check the email rendering](email-rendering.md) in popular desktop, mobile and web-based clients
* [Send test emails](proofs.md) to specific recipients for testing and validation

These actions can be performed from the **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** button, which is accessible from the [Edit content](../content/edit-content.md) screen or from the [Email Designer](../content/get-started-email-designer.md).

>Content simulation is also available from the [delivery summary](../monitor/prepare-send.md) after clicking the **[!UICONTROL Review and send]** button.
