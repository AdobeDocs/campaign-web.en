Once your delivery content has been defined, you can use profiles and test profiles to preview and test it before sending the message.

This is an crucial step to ensure that it is accurate but also free of errors both in content and personalization settings.

To do this, [!DNL Adobe Campaign] allows you to:

* [Preview the message content and personalization](preview-content.md)
* [Send test deliveries](test-deliveries.md) (proofs) to specific recipients or subscribers for testing and validation
* [Check the email rendering](email-rendering.md) in popular desktop, mobile and web-based clients
* [Preview and test your landing pages](../landing-pages/create-lp.md#test-landing-page)

These actions can be performed using the **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** button, which is accessible from the edit content screen of your delivery - or from the [Email Designer](../email/get-started-email-designer.md).
