Once the email content has been defined, you can check how it will display before sending it. This allows you to test the email in order to detect possible errors in content or personalization settings.

To do this, Adobe Campaign allows you to:

* [Preview the email content and personalization](#preview) using profile data,
<!--* [Check the email rendering](#rendering) in popular desktop, mobile and web-based clients,-->
* [Send proofs](#send-proofs) to specific recipients in order to test and validate the email.

These actions are performed from the **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** button which is accessible when creating the content of your email:
