Adobe Campaign allows you to use profiles to preview the content of your email before sending in order to check personalization and how your recipients will see them.

Messages can be previewed using:

* **Test profiles**: send proofs to additional recipients in the database that are not part of the email target,
* **Profiles from the email audience**: test the email by placing yourself in the position of one of the targeted profiles. This allows you to get an exact representation of the message that the profile will receive like custom fields, personalized information...

To preview the content of your email, follow these steps:

1. Choose the profile(s) to use to preview your email content. To do this, click the **[!UICONTROL Select profile(s)]** button then use the **[!UICONTROL Test profiles]** and **[!UICONTROL Profiles]** tab to select one or multiple profile(s).

1. Once your profiles have been selected, a preview of the email displays in the right pane. Personalized elements are replaced by the data from the selected profile.

    If you have added multiple profiles, you can switch between each of them in the list to preview the corresponding email.
