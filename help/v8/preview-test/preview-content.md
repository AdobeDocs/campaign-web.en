Use content simulation capability in Adobe Campaign to preview the content of your email before sending it, to control personalization, and check how it is displayed to your recipients.

To preview the content of your email, follow these steps:

1. Browse to the email content creation screen, and click the **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** button.

    * The **[!UICONTROL Test profiles]** tab lists all seed addresses, which are additional and fictitious recipients in the database. They can be created in Adobe Campaign console into the **[!UICONTROL Resources]** / **[!UICONTROL Campaign Management]** / **[!UICONTROL Seed addresses]** folder.
    * The **[!UICONTROL Profiles]** tab lists all the recipients stored into the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and Targets]** folder from the Campaign console.

1. Once profiles have been selected, a preview of the email is displayed in the right pane. Personalized elements are replaced by the data from the profile selected in the left pane.

    If you have added multiple profiles, you can switch between them in the list to preview the corresponding email content.

1. You can preview the rendering of your content on different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet), by clicking the dedicated icon in the top right corner.
