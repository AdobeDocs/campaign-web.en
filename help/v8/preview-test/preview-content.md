Adobe Campaign allows you to preview the content of your email before sending it to check personalization and how it will appear to your recipients.

You can preview an email using:

* **Test profiles**: Preview the email using seed addresses, which are additional and fictitious recipients in the database,
* **Profiles**: Preview the email using an existing profile.

To preview the content of your email, follow these steps:

1. Access the email content creation screen and click the **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** button.

1. Select one or multiple profiles by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Select profile(s)]** button, then use the **[!UICONTROL Test profiles]** and **[!UICONTROL Profiles]** tabs to choose from.

    You can combine both test profiles and profiles to preview your email.

1. Once profiles have been selected, a preview of the email will be displayed in the right pane. Personalized elements will be replaced by the data from the profile selected in the left pane.

    If you have added multiple profiles, you can switch between them in the list to preview the corresponding email.

    You can also preview the rendering of your content on different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet), by clicking the dedicated icon in the top right corner.
