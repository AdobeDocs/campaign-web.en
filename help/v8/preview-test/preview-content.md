Adobe Campaign allows you to use profiles to preview the content of your email before sending in order to check personalization and how your recipients will see them.

Messages can be previewed using:

* **Test profiles**: preview the email using seed addresses, which are additional recipients in the database that are not part of the email target,
* **Profiles**: preview the email using an existing profile.

To preview the content of your email, follow these steps:

1. Choose the profile(s) to use to preview your email content. To do this, click the **[!UICONTROL Select profile(s)]** button then use the **[!UICONTROL Test profiles]** and **[!UICONTROL Profiles]** tab to select one or multiple profile(s).

1. Once your profiles have been selected, a preview of the email displays in the right pane. Personalized elements are replaced by the data from the selected profile.

    If you have added multiple profiles, you can switch between each of them in the list to preview the corresponding email.
