workflow canvas overview and principle


Once that you have [created a workflow](create-workflow.md), either from the workflow menu or within a campaign, you can start orchestrating the differents tasks that it will perform.

To do this, a visual canvas allows you to build a workflow diagram, in which you can add various activities and link them together in a sequential order.

* [Learn how to add and connect workflow ativities](#activities)

## Work with the workflow canvas {#canvas}

* status and last processing date and time
* navigation tool bar (zoom, fit to screen, display map)
* central canvas where you orchestrate activities
* configure workflow settings
* activity configuration pane

## Add and connect activites {#activities}

* start and end a workflow
* how to add/remove activities
* work with transitions: view results, add labels to transitions
* relationship between activites: what activites you can add or not depeding on the previous one

Once that you have successfully designed the workflow diagram, you can execute the workflow and track how its various tasks are being performed. [Learn how to start a workflow and monitor its execution](start-monitor-workflows.md)
