# Start & monitor workflow execution {#start-monitor}

Once that you have created your workflow and designed the tasks to perform in the workflow canvas, you can launch its execution and monitor how it is being executed. 

* how to run the workflow

* track its execution in real-time. 

    By default: activity status display + result in transitions. Hide progression button to hide

    blue visual flow

* pause/stop the workflow. resume a workflow after being paused.

* access logs and tasks

* what happens in case of error: visual indicators + status

    <!--to reformulate-->You can configure the workflow so that it does not pause and continues execution in case of errors. To do this, edit workflow Properties and, in the Error management section, select the Ignore option in the In case of error field. You may then specify the number of consecutive errors that can be ignored before the process is paused.
