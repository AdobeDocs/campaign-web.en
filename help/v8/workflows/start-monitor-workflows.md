# Start & monitor workflow execution {#start-monitor}

Once that you have created your workflow and designed the tasks to perform in the canvas, you can launch it and monitor how it is being executed. 

## Start the workflow {#start}

To start the workflow, open it from the Workflows menu or the associated campaign and click the Start button in the upper-right corner of the canvas.

Once the workflow is running, each activity in the canvas is being executed in a sequential order, until the end of the workflow is reached.

You can track in real-time the progress of the targeted profiles in the workflow thanks to a visual flow. This allows you to quickly identify the status of each activity and how many profiles are navigating on each transition.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can disable the visual flow using the Hide progression button in the top toolbar of the canvas.

## Monitor activities execution {#activities}

Visual indicators in the upper-right corner of each activity allows you to check their execution:

|Visual indicator | Description | 
|-----|------------|
