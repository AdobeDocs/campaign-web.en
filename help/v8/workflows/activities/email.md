how to add and configure the activity

example of a configured activity within a workflow


The Email delivery activity allows you to configure the sending an email in a workflow. 

<!-- Scheduled emails available?

This can be a single send email and sent just once, or it can be a recurring email.
* Single send emails are standard emails, sent once.
* Recurring emails allow you to send the same email multiple times to different targets over a defined period. You can aggregate the deliveries per period in order to get reports that correspond to your needs.

When linked to a scheduler, you can define recurring emails.-->

Email recipients are defined upstream of the activity in the same workflow, via an Audience targeting activity.

<!--The message preparation is triggered according to the workflow execution parameters. From the message dashboard, you can select whether to request or not a manual confirmation to send the message (required by default). You can start the workflow manually or place a scheduler activity in the workflow to automate execution.-->
