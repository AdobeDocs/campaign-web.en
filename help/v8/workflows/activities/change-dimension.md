The **Change dimension** activity is a **Targeting** activity. This activity allows you to change the targeting dimension as you are building an audience. This activity shifts the axis depending on the data template and the input dimension. For example, you can switch from the "contracts" dimension to the "clients" dimension.

You can also use this activity to define the additional columns of the new target, and define data deduplication criteria.
