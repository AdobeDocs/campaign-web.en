The **JavaScript code** activity is a **Data management** activity. Use this activity to execute a JavaScript script in the context of a workflow. This allows you to collect information from the database or perform other complex operations.

## Configure the JavaScript code activity {#javascript-code-configuration}

Follow these steps to configure the **JavaScript code** activity:

1. Drag and drop a **JavaScript code** activity into your workflow.

1. Choose which type of activity you want to create:

    * **Simple**: Execute one code snippet.
    * **Advanced**: This option allows you to perform more advanced operations by executing two different code snippets. [Learn how to configure an advanced JavaScript activity](#advanced)

1. Confirm then click the **[!UICONTROL Edit code]** button to open the expression editor. The left hand-side pane provides predefined syntaxes that you can leverage to build your code:

    * The **[!UICONTROL Event variables]** menu allows you to use [events variable](#event-variables) from the workflow into your code.
    * The **[!UICONTROL Conditions]** menu provides functions that allow you to build conditions. [Learn how to create condtions in the expression editor](../../personalization/conditions.md#condition-perso-editor)
    * The **[!UICONTROL Add current date]** menu provides functions related to date formatting.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Execution]** section, configure the delay to stop the activity after a period of execution. By default, the execution phase cannot exceed 1 hour. After this delay, the process is aborted with an error message and the activity execution fails. To ignore this limit, set the value to 0.

1. Toggle on the **[!UICONTROL Process errors]** option to keep errors that occur during the script execution in an additional output transition.

## Advanced JavaScript code activities {#advanced}

Advanced JavaScript activities allow you to perform complex operations by executing two different code snippets. The first code snippet is executed the first time the workflow is started. Each time the workflow runs again, the code snippet defined in the second call is executed.

To configure an Advanced JavaScript code activity, choose the **Advanced** type, then configure the code snippets to execute: 

* Click **[!UICONTROL Edit first call code]** to define the script to execute during the first call.
* Click **[!UICONTROL Edit next call code]** to define the script to execute during the next calls of the workflow.

Advanced JavaScript code activities allow you to configure output transitions and interact with them dynamically through the code snippets. To add output transitions, click the **[!UICONTROL Add transitions]** button and specify a label and an internal name for each transition.

In this example we have configured two transitions that are activated by the script in the code snippet based on specific conditions.

## Workflows objects & variables {#event-variables}

JavaScripts executed in the context of a workflow access a series of additional global **objects** such as the workflow itself that is being executed (`Ã¬nstance`), its various tasks (`task`), or the events that activated a given task (`event`).

To each type of **object** is associated a category of **variables** that can be leveraged in your JavaScript code.

* **Instance variables** (`instance.vars.xxx`) are comparable to global variables. They are shared by all activities.
* **Task variables** (`task.vars.xxx`) are comparable to local variables. They are only used by the current task. These variables are used by persistent activities to keep data and are sometimes used to exchange data between the different scripts of a same activity.
* **Event variables** (`vars.xxx`) enable the exchange of data between the elementary tasks of a workflow process. These variables are passed by the task that activated the task in progress. They are then passed to the following activities.

**Event variables** are the most often used variables, and they should be used in preference to instance variables. Predefined event variables are available for use in the expression editor left-hand side pane. You can also create new ones by initializing a new variable in your JavaScript code.

## Example {#javascript-code-example}

### Initialize variables based on the incoming population {#example1}

This example shows how to initialize a variable based on the number of profiles targeted by a workflow. 

![](../assets/javascript-example1.png)

Here, we are targeting VIP profiles from our database. We want to create a variable named "channel" with a value that depend on the number of profiles targeted by the Build audience activity:

* If more than 1000 profiles are targeted, intialize the variable with the value "email".
* Otherwise, initialize it with the value "sms". 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Add a **JavaScript code** activity with the type **Simple** after the **Build audience** activity.

1. Click **Edit code** and configure the code snippet as below:

    ```
    if (vars.recCount > 1000)
        vars.channel ="email"
    else
        vars.channel = "sms"
    ```

1. Start the workflow. The "channel" variable is created with the "email" or "sms" value, depending on the number of profiles targeted by the **Build audience** activity.

### Trigger transitions based on a variable's value {#example2}

This example shows how to trigger a transition based on the value of a variable.

![](../assets/javascript-example2-transitions.png)

Here, the workflow starts with an **External signal** activity, into which a variable (`interest`) is passed from another workflow. The value of the variable is either "running" or "yoga", depending on the filtering operations performed in the initial workflow.

We want to trigger different transitions in the workflow, based on the value of the variable.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Add a **JavaScript code** activity after the External signal activity with the type **Advanced**.

1. Add two transitions: one for each possible variable value ("running", "yoga").

1. Click **Edit first call code** and configure the code snippet as below:

    ```
    if (vars.interest=="running")
        task.postEvent(task.transitionByName("running"));
    else
        task.postEvent(task.transitionByName("yoga"));
    ```
1. Start the workflow. One of the two output transitions is activated, based on the value of the `interest` variable that has been passed through the External signal activity.
