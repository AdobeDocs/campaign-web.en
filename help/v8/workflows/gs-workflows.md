# Get started with workflows {#workflows}

## What is a workflow?

Cross-channel marketing is essential for any business aiming to reach its customers effectively. Adobe Campaign provides a comprehensive graphical environment that enables you to design complex processes to manage your marketing campaigns with ease.

With workflows, you orchestrate a full range of processes and tasks, improving the speed and scale of every aspect of your marketing campaigns, from creating segments and preparing messages to delivery. Additionally, you synchronize your channels using a single, easy-to-use interface for campaign orchestration.

One of the key advantages of workflows is their ability to simplify the delivery of personalized content to customers across all channels. Whether customers prefer receiving messages via email or mobile, Adobe Campaign ensures a consistent and contextual experience on any channel, transforming every customer's journey into a unique experience.

## Practical uses for workflows

Workflows are highly versatile and applicable in various contexts, including targeting to manage audiences or send messages, data management (ETL) to manipulate data, and importing data into the Adobe Campaign database.

Using Adobe Campaign's graphical environment, you design processes such as segmentation, campaign execution, and file processing. Workflows also involve users by assigning tasks or requiring approval for performed tasks, simplifying team management and ensuring accuracy.

Here are some examples of how workflows can be used with Adobe Campaign:

* Launch a follow-up campaign for inactive customers,
* Send a welcome email to all new subscribers to a service,
* Personalize cross-channel deliveries based on customers' loyalty program status or points of interest.
