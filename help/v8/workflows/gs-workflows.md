## What is a workflow?

Cross-channel marketing is essential for any business looking to reach its customers effectively. Adobe Campaign provides a comprehensive graphical environment that empowers you to design complex processes that can help you manage your marketing campaigns with ease.

With workflows, you can orchestrate the full range of processes and tasks, improve the speed and scale of every aspect of your marketing campaigns, from creating segments and preparing messages to delivery. Plus, you can get your channels in sync with a single, easy-to-use interface for campaign orchestration.

One of the most significant advantages of using workflows is that it makes it simple to deliver personalized content to your customers across all channels. Whether your customers prefer to receive messages via email or mobile, Adobe Campaign allows you to deliver a consistent and contextual experience on any channel, transforming every customer's journey into a unique experience.

## Practical uses for workflows

Workflows are incredibly versatile and can be used in various contexts, including targeting to manage audiences or send messages, data management (ETL) to manipulate data, and importing data into the Adobe Campaign database.

With the comprehensive graphical environment of Adobe Campaign, you can design processes such as segmentation, campaign execution, file processing. Workflows can also involve users by assigning them tasks or having them approve performed tasks, making it easier to manage your team's work and ensure that everything is done correctly.

Here are some examples of how you can use workflows with Adobe Campaign:

* Download a file from a server, decompress it, and then import records contained within into the Adobe Campaign database.
* Create a delivery action, assign a task to one or more operators to work on content, specify targets, and approve proofs before starting the delivery.
