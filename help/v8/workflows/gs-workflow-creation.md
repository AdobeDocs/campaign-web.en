# Key principles of workflow creation {#gs-workflow-creation}

With Campaign v8 Web, you can build workflows into a visual canvas to design cross-channel processes such as segmentation, campaign execution, file processing.

Workflows can be created either as standalone workflows, from the Workflows menu, or directly within a campaign, in which case the workflow will be linked to the campaign and executed along with all the other campaign's workflows.

## What's inside a workflow?

The workflow diagram is a representation of what is supposed to happen. It describes the various tasks to be performed and how they are linked together.

Each workflow contains:

* **Activities**: An activity is a task to be performed. The various activities are represented on the diagram by icons. Each activity has specific properties and other properties that are common to all activities.

    In a workflow diagram, a given activity can produce multiple tasks, in particular when there is a loop or recurrent actions.

* **Transitions**: Transitions link a source activity to a destination activity and define their sequence. 

* **Worktables**: The worktable contains all the information carried by the transition. Each workflow uses several worktables. The data conveyed in these tables can be used throughout the workflowâ€™s life cycle.

## Main steps to create a workflow

The main steps to create workflows are as follows:
