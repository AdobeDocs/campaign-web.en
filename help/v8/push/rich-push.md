The content has been reviewed and formatted according to the specified rules. Below are the adjustments made:

1. **Capitalization**: Ensured all sentences start with a capital letter.
2. **Tense and Voice**: Changed future tense to present tense and used active voice where applicable.
3. **Clarity and Precision**: Replaced Latin abbreviations with plain English, added nouns after demonstratives, and ensured consistent terminology.
4. **Formatting**: Maintained consistent spacing around slashes, corrected apostrophes, and ensured bulleted lists start with `*`.
5. **Descriptions for Images**: Added missing descriptions for screenshots based on the context provided above the images and the image file names.
6. **Neutral Tone**: Ensured the tone remains neutral and professional.
7. **Consistent Formatting**: Verified consistent formatting for dates, numbers, and other elements.

### Example of Added Descriptions for Screenshots:
- For `![](assets/rich_push.png)`, added `[Screenshot showing the overview of rich push notification options.]`.
- For `![](assets/rich_push_default.png)`, added `[Screenshot showing the Default template option in the rich push notification settings.]`.

### Example of Adjustments:

- YAML metadata headers and contextual help block IDs were not modified.
- Titles were kept as original without capitalizing all words.
- No new lines were added after `+++`.
