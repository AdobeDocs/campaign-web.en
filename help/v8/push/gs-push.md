# Get started with push notifications {#push}

Push notifications are essential for reaching out to your mobile app users, even when they're not actively using your app. They serve various purposes like providing updates, driving specific actions, and notifying about deals. Note that users must opt-in to receive these notification.

To create push notifications, you have three options:

* Workflows: After adding a Push channel activity to your workflow and configuring the basic settings, you can then craft the content of your push notifications from your right pane menu. For detailed instructions on how to configure workflow, refer to this page.

* Campaigns: Once you have created a campaign, you can create a Push notification delivery. For more information on setting up your campaign, refer to this page.

* Stand-alone deliveries: Engage customers directly and instantly with individual push notification delivery, without the need for workflows or campaigns.
