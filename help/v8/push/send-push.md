## Preview your push notification delivery {#preview-push}

Once you have defined your message content, you can utilize test profiles to preview and test the message. If you have included personalized content, you can examine how this content is displayed in the message by utilizing test profile data. This allows you to ensure that the message is being rendered correctly and that the personalized elements are being appropriately incorporated.

1. From your delivery content page, you can use **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** to preview your personalized content.

Using **Adobe Campaign**, you have the ability to test push notifications before sending them to your main audience. This step is important in validating your delivery and identifying any issues. 
Test recipients can review elements such as links, images, and personalization settings, ensuring optimal performance and detecting any errors. This process helps you refine and optimize your push notifications before reaching your main audience.
