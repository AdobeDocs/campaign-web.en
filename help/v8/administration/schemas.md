**[!DNL Adobe Campaign]** uses XML-based schemas to define the physical and logical structure of data within the application. A schema is an XML document linked to a database table that defines:

* The SQL table structure, including table name, fields, and relationships.
* The XML data structure, including elements, attributes, hierarchy, types, default values, and labels.

Schemas play a key role in:

* Mapping application data to database tables.
* Defining relationships between data objects.
* Specifying the structure and properties of each field.

Each entity in Adobe Campaign has a dedicated schema, ensuring data consistency and organization.

The schemas interface allows you to:

* [Browse and access schemas](schemas-browse-access.md) - Navigate to the schemas menu, view available schemas and explore their details.
* [Customize screen display](schemas-customize-screen.md) - Configure displayed columns, fields, collection lists, and organize your layout.
* [Create and manage schemas](schemas-create-publish.md#create-schemas) - Create new schemas and extend existing ones
* [Publish and synchronize schemas](schemas-create-publish.md#publish) - Synchronize schema changes with the database structure.
* [Work with custom forms](schemas-custom-forms.md) - Create, edit, and manage records in custom schemas using data entry forms.

Detailed information on schemas is available in the [Campaign console documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/developer/shemas-forms/schemas){target="_blank"}.
