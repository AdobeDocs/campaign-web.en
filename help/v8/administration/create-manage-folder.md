# Create and Manage a Folder

In Adobe Campaign, you can create new folders to manage your navigation tree. In **[!UICONTROL Explorer]**, go to the folder in which you want to create your new folder.

Under the **[!UICONTROL ...]** button, You have **[!UICONTROL Create new folder]**

  ![](assets/folder_create.png){zoomable="yes"}

When you create a new folder, by default, the folder type is the type of the folder parent. 
In our example, we create a folder in the **[!UICONTROL Deliveries]** folder.

  ![](assets/folder_new.png){zoomable="yes"}

You can change the type of your folder by clicking on the icon of Folder type, and you can choose it in the list presented : 

  ![](assets/folder_type.png){zoomable="yes"}

You will setup the folder type by clicking on **[!UICONTROL Confirm]** button.

If you want to create a folder with no specific type, choose **[!UICONTROL Generic Folder]** type.

In Adobe Campaign console, you have the process of creation and management of a folder explained [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/config/configuration/folders-and-views), and you have the possibility to setup permissions on folders.
