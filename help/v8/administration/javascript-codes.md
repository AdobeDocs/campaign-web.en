## About JavaScript codes {#about}

JavaScript codes allow you to create reusable functions that can be utilized across workflows, similar to a library. These functions are stored in the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL JavaScript codes]** menu in the left navigation pane.

From the JavaScript codes list, you can:

* **Duplicate or delete a code**: Click the ellipsis button and select the desired action.
* **Modify a code**: Click a code's name to open its properties. Make your changes and save.
* **Create a new JavaScript code**: Click the **[!UICONTROL Create JavaScript code]** button.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Although the JavaScript codes menu location differs between the Adobe Campaign console and Web user interface, the list is identical and operates like a mirror.

## Create a JavaScript code {#create}

To create a JavaScript code, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL JavaScript codes]** menu and click the **[!UICONTROL Create JavaScript code]** button.

1. Define the code's properties:

    * **[!UICONTROL Namespace]**: Specify the namespace relevant to your custom resources. By default, the namespace is "cus" but it may vary depending on your implementation.
    * **[!UICONTROL Name]**: The unique identifier to use to reference the code.
    * **[!UICONTROL Label]**: The descriptive label to display in the JavaScript codes list.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Once created, the **[!UICONTROL Namespace]** and **[!UICONTROL Name]** fields cannot be modified. To make changes, duplicate the code and update as needed.
    >
    >In the Campaign console, the JavaScript code name appears as a concatenation of these two fields.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Create code]** button to define the JavaScript code. The left pane provides two menus that allow you to use predefined functions related to conditions and date formatting.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Confirm]** to save your code.

1. When your JavaScript code is ready, click **[!UICONTROL Create]**.  The JavaScript code is now available for use across workflows.

## Use a JavaScript code from a workflow {#workflow}

### Load JavaScript code libraries {#library}

You can reference JavaScript codes in workflows to avoid rewriting code for repetitive tasks. To use these codes, you first need to load the corresponding library in the workflowâ€™s initialization script. This allows you to load all the libraries containing the functions you want to use in your workflow once.

To load a library, follow these steps:

1. Open a workflow and click the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** button.
1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Initialization script]** section and click **[!UICONTROL Create code]**.

1. Use the syntax below in the code to load a library:

    ```
    loadLibrary("/<namespace>/<name>")
    ```

    * Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace specified during the JavaScript code creation.
    * Replace `<name>` with the name of the JavaScript code.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Confirm]** and save the settings. 

### Reference functions in workflows {#reference}

Once the JavaScript library is loaded, you can reference the functions defined in the JavaScript code directly within the workflow, typically using a **[!UICONTROL JavaScript code]** activity.
