# Access and permissions {#access-and-permissions}


Access control can restrict access to objects and data from main lists, such as deliveries, recipients, or worklows. These restrictions also apply in the Explorer navigation tree. In addition, you need permissions to create, delete, duplicate, and edit objects from the user interface. Access control is managed in the Client Console. All permissions in Campaign Web are synched up with Campaign Client Console permissions. Only Campaign Administrators can define and modify user permissions. Learn more about user permissions in [Campaign v8 (client console) documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/admin/permissions/gs-permissions.html){target="_blank"}.

As you are browsing Camopaign Web user interface, you can access data, objects and capabilities depending on your permissions. For example, if you do not have access permissions to a folder, you cannot see it. Your permissions also affect objects and data management. Without Write permissions for a specific folder, you cannot create a delivery in that folder, even if you can see it in the user interface.
