## Discover Campaign Web user interface {#web}

Initially available only through a rich [client console](#ac-client), Campaign now offers a new web user interface (UI) with enhanced usability, accessibility, and a new design to significantly improve your user experience. This modern UI simplifies marketing campaign design and delivery and brings consistency with other Adobe solutions, including Adobe Experience Platform.

![Screenshot of the Adobe Campaign Web user interface home screen](assets/home.png){zoomable="yes"}

This new Web user interface primarily serves the needs of **business practitioners**. Typical administration tasks are not available in this initial version but will be addressed in subsequent versions. Note that not every functionality or option available in the client console is currently accessible in the new UI. New use cases, options, and features will be introduced in future releases.

As an administrator or expert user, if you need to access Campaign v8 capabilities that are not available in the Campaign Web user interface, connect to the [client console](#ac-client).

## About Campaign client console {#ac-client}

The client console is designed for administrators and advanced users to perform their tasks. The Campaign client console is a browser-based application installed on your system. It uses the web services API to connect to your Campaign application server.

Campaign data is stored in the application server. Data is accessible both from the client console and the Campaign Web user interface. For example, if you create a delivery template using the client console, it is also available in the Campaign Web user interface. Similarly, if you create an email delivery in the Campaign Web user interface, this delivery is accessible from the client console.

Some objects can only be created and managed in the client console. These objects can be visible and used in the Campaign Web user interface but cannot be created or modified from this environment. All Campaign objects and components are available from the Explorer view, accessible from the left navigation.

For more information on how to use Campaign v8 with its client console, refer to [Campaign v8 (client console) documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/campaign-home.html){target="_blank"}.

Adobe Campaign is a cross-channel marketing solution that automates email, mobile, social, and offline campaigns. Adobe Campaign provides a central place to access your customer data and profiles. Use Adobe Campaign to orchestrate consistent experiences for your customers, design, execute, and personalize your marketing across channels, while improving customer experiences on every device and touchpoint.

**Administrate environment**

* **Connect to your environment(s)** - Once the client console is installed, follow the steps in this documentation to create the connection to the application server.

* **Define permissions** - Adobe Campaign lets you define and manage the rights assigned to users. These permissions are defined by combining operator group permissions, named rights, and permissions on folders.

* **Use Campaign control panel** - The Adobe Campaign Control Panel allows Adobe Campaign administrators to monitor key assets and perform administrative tasks, such as managing the SFTP storage by instance, managing GPG keys, or subdomains and certificates.

    Control Panel allows you to set up new connections to your instances by adding IP address ranges to the allow list.
    Subdomain configuration allows you to configure a sub-section of your domain (technically a "DNS zone") for use with Adobe Campaign.
    In the Control Panel, you can interact with all SFTP servers that are connected to Campaign instances that you have access to.

* **Use the audit trail** - In Adobe Campaign Web User Interface, the Audit trail feature provides users with full visibility into all modifications made to important entities within your instance, typically those that significantly impact a smooth operation of the instance.

**Set up user interface**

* **Customize campaign UI** - Guidelines for managing user interface settings like lists, units, or data display.

* **Add custom fields** - Custom fields are additional attributes added to the out-of-the-box schemas through the Adobe Campaign console. These custom fields are displayed in various screens, for example, the details of a profile or a test profile.

**Set up the branding**

Every company has brand guidelines that define both visual elements and technical details. Adobe Campaign helps you manage these guidelines centrally, so you can present a consistent brand image to your customers in everything you do, from logos in emails to the URLs and domains used in your campaigns.

**Understand data model creation**

Adobe Campaign comes with a pre-defined data model. This section gives some details on the built-in tables of the Adobe Campaign data model and their interaction. Adobe Campaign relies on a Cloud database containing tables that are linked together.

A schema is an XML document associated with a database table. It defines data structure and describes the SQL definition of the table.
When you create or extend a schema, you need to create or modify the associated input forms to make those changes visible to end-users.
An input form lets you edit an instance associated with a data schema from the Adobe Campaign client console. The form is identified by its name and namespace.

**Understand data management**

Use Adobe Campaign workflows to improve the speed and scale of every aspect of your marketing campaigns, from creating segments and preparing messages to delivery.

Campaign helps you add contacts to the Cloud database. You can load a file, schedule and automate multiple contact updates, collect data on the Web, or enter profile information directly into the recipient table.

You can easily export your different reports to PDF or CSV format, which enables you to share, manipulate, or print them.
Quarantine is the way to manage the invalid addresses in deliveries.

**About delivery management**

Campaign Optimization is the Adobe Campaign module which lets you control, filter, and monitor the sending of deliveries. To avoid conflicts between campaigns, Adobe Campaign can test various combinations by applying specific constraint rules. This guarantees that the messages sent meet the needs and expectations of customers and company communication policies.

All marketing campaigns are based on a template, which stores main characteristics and capabilities. Campaign comes with a built-in template to create campaigns. This template has all functionalities enabled: Documents, Seed addresses, Approvals, Delivery outlines, etc.

* **Landing pages** - Once you design your landing page content, you can save it for future reuse.

**Use subscription services**

Use Adobe Campaign Web to manage and create your services such as newsletters, and to check the subscriptions or unsubscriptions to these services.
