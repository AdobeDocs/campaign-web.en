Adobe Campaign provides a platform for designing cross-channel customer experiences and an environment for visual campaign orchestration, real-time interaction management and cross channel execution.

Initially only available through a rich [client console](#ac-client), Campaign now provides a new web user interface (UI) with enhanced usability, accessibility, and a new design to significantly improve your user experience. This new modern UI simplifies marketing campaign design and delivery, and brings consistency, along with other Adobe solutions, including Adobe Experience Platform.

This new UI first serves the needs of the **business practitioner** â€“ all typical administration tasks are not available in this first version, but will be addressed in subsequent versions. Note that not every single functionality or option available in the client console is available for now in the new UI. New use-cases, options and features will be available in future releases.

If you need to access Campaign v8 capabilities which are not available in the web UI, you can use the [client console](#ac-client). 


>[!NOTE]

>Campaign v8 Web is currently in Limited Availability (LA) version. Access is restricted to a small set of LA customers. Please be aware that product interface, capabilities and usage flows can change without notice.

## About Campaign client console {#ac-client}

The Campaign client console is a browser-based application which is installed on your system. It uses the web services API to connect to your Campaign application server.

Campaign data is stored in the application server. Data is available both from the client console and from the web UI. For example, if you create a delivery template using the client console, it is also available in the web UI. And if you create an email delivery in the web UI, this delivery is also accessible from the client console.

Some objects can only be created and managed in the client console. They can be visible and used in Campaign Web UI, but cannot be created nor modified from this environment. All Campaign objects and components are available from the Explorer view, available from the left navigation.

For more information on how to use Campaign v8, refer to [Campaign v8 (client console) documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/campaign-home.html){target="_blank"}.
