Adobe Campaign provides a platform for designing cross-channel customer experiences and an environment for visual campaign orchestration, real-time interaction management and cross channel execution.

In addition to all the existing features available with the console, we've built a web interface for practionners which offers an integrated, intuitive and consistent user experience. This modern web-based UI is currently only available to Alpha customers with the following capabilities:

**Modern, intuitive and unified experience**

* Access to the new interface and other applications with a single and shared user session
* Unified Shell intgration: access to community learnings, help center, solution switcher
<!--
No search and pulse notifications in Alpha
-->
* Experience the new navigation with left menus and folders

**Create, launch and measure your single email campaign**

* Design personalized email content with the email editor
* Define Audiences with the segment builder
* Preview, test and send your email messages
* Monitor sending and measure results with built-in reports 

<!--
add info somewhere to remind users that
* they still have access to their console (+ link to v8 console doc)
* they keep their existing data (example: will be able to use their existing delivery templates to create deliveries)
