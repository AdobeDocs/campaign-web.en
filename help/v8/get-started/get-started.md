Adobe Campaign provides a platform for designing cross-channel customer experiences and an environment for visual campaign orchestration, real-time interaction management and cross channel execution.

Adobe Campaign v8 is the next-gen campaign tool built for various marketing channels such as email, push notifications, SMS, and direct mail. It provides robust ETL and data management capabilities to help craft and curate the perfect campaign. Its orchestration engine provides for rich multi-touch marketing programs with a core focus on batch-based driven journeys. It also comes paired with a scalable real-time messaging server that enables marketing teams to send pre-defined messages based on a all-inclusive payload from any IT system for communications such as password reset, order confirmation, e-receipt's and much more.

Use Campaign to:

* **Drive** personalization and engagement through a single accessible view of the customer
* **Integrate** email, mobile, online and offline channels into the customer journey
* **Automate** the delivery of meaningful and timely messages and offers 


Initially only available through a rich [client console](#ac-client), Campaign now provides a new web user interface (UI) with enhanced usability, accessibility, and a new design to significantly improve your user experience. This new modern UI simplifies marketing campaign design and delivery, and brings consistency, along with other Adobe solutions, including Adobe Experience Platform.

This new Web user interface first serves the needs of the **business practitioner** â€“ all typical administration tasks are not available in this first version, but will be addressed in subsequent versions. Note that not every single functionality or option available in the client console is available for now in the new UI. New use-cases, options and features will be available in future releases.

As an administrator or expert user, if you need to access Campaign v8 capabilities which are not available in Campaign Web user interface, you can connect to the [client console](#ac-client).

>Adobe Campaign Web is currently in Limited Availability (LA) version. Access is restricted to a small set of LA customers. Please be aware that product interface, capabilities and usage flows can change without notice.

## About Campaign client console {#ac-client}

The Campaign client console is a browser-based application which is installed on your system. It uses the web services API to connect to your Campaign application server.

Campaign data is stored in the application server. Data is available both from the client console and from Campaign Web user interface. For example, if you create a delivery template using the client console, it is also available in Campaign Web user interface. And if you create an email delivery in Campaign Web user interface, this delivery is also accessible from the client console.

Some objects can only be created and managed in the client console. They can be visible and used in Campaign Web user interface, but cannot be created nor modified from this environment. All Campaign objects and components are available from the Explorer view, available from the left navigation.

For more information on how to use Campaign v8 with its client console, refer to [Campaign v8 (client console) documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/campaign-home.html){target="_blank"}.
