>Campaign v8 web is currently in Alpha version. Access is restricted to a small set of Alpha customers. Please be aware that product interface, capabilities and usage flows can change without notice.

Adobe Campaign provides a platform for designing cross-channel customer experiences and an environment for visual campaign orchestration, real-time interaction management and cross channel execution.

In addition to all the existing features available with the console, we've built a web interface to provide practitioners with an integrated, intuitive and consistent user experience. 

## Alpha features

This modern web-based interface is currently only available to Alpha practitioners with the following capabilities:

**Modern, intuitive and unified experience**

* Access to the new interface and other applications with a single and shared user session
* Unified Shell integration: access to community learnings, help center, solution switcher
<!--
No search and pulse notifications in Alpha
-->
* Experience the new navigation with left menus and folders

**Create, launch and measure your email campaign**

* Design personalized email content with the email editor
* Define audiences with the segment builder
* Preview, test and send your email messages
* Monitor send and measure results with built-in reports 

<!--
add info somewhere to remind users that
* they still have access to their console (+ link to v8 console doc)
* they keep their existing data (example: will be able to use their existing delivery templates to create deliveries)
-->

## The client console

If you need to use a Campaign v8 feature that is not available in the web UI, you can use the client console. For more information on how to use Campaign v8, refer to the [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/campaign-home.html?lang=en).

The data is shared between the console and the web UI. For example, if you created a delivery template using the console, it will be available in the web interface.
