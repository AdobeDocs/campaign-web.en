Artificial intelligence and machine learning models improve over time to better address specific use cases. Campaign AI-powered Contextual Help continues to improve. Use the <img src="assets/do-not-localize/thumb.png" width="10%"/> buttons whenever you read an answer to flag inappropriate responses to our engineers.

## Recommendations {#recommendations-ai}

When asking a question in the AI-powered Contextual Help, the current product context, such as the screen you are in and the content of the current help box, is taken into account.

As a result, the best practice is to ask questions related to the user interface context. For example, if you need to learn how to send a push delivery in a workflow, browse to the **Workflow** left menu entry and use a contextual help box in that specific context. To learn more about reporting metrics, browse to the campaign or delivery reports and start from there.

To maximize the benefits of the AI-powered Contextual Help, follow these recommendations:

* Be precise and specific, avoiding ambiguity. Accurate answers depend on clear questions. 
* Provide detailed information about what you are trying to learn to help the AI-powered Contextual Help find the correct information.
* Rephrase and refine your questions to improve the accuracy of answers. If the answer is not helpful, try different approaches and add context.
* Use appropriate terms and wording with a neutral tone.
* Rate the answers and provide feedback to help engineers improve results.
