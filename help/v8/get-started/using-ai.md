When asking a question in the AI-powered Contextual Help, the current product context, i.e the screen you are in, and the content of the current help box,  are taken into account.

As a consequence, best practice is to ask questions related to the user interface context. For example, if you need to learn how to send a push delivery in a workflow, browse to the **Workflow** left menu entry, and use a contextual help box in that specific context. To learn more about reporting metrics, browse to the campaign or delivery reports, and start from there.
