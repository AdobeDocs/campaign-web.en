# Campaign Web user interface/client console capability matrix {#capabilities-matrix}

Key Campaign capabilities are available in Campaign Web user interface. This interface was primary designed for marketers to plan, launch and measure their marketing campaigns. All capabilities are listed [in this page](../rn/whats-new.md). 

Campaign platform customization based on business and data needs, and connection to other systems are managed in the Campaign client console.
