# Discover the interface {#user-interface}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="acw_homepage_learnmore"
>title="Discover the interface"
>abstract="The new Campaign v8 Web interface offers an integrated, intuitive, and consistent user experience."

The new Campaign v8 Web interface offers a modern and intuitive user experience to simplify marketing campaign design and delivery. This new interface is integrated with Adobe Experience Platform. 


>[!NOTE]
>
>This documentation is frequently updated to reflect latest changes in the product user interface. However, some screenshots can slightly differ from your user interface.


## Left navigation menu {#user-interface-left-nav}

Browse the links on the left to access Campaign v8 Web capabilities. Several links display lists of objects which can be sorted and filtered. You can also configure columns to display all the information you need. See this [section](#list-screens). All list screens are read-only, except the email delivery list. Clicking on any list item for edition/viewing is not available in Alpha. All lists will be editable in future versions. The items displayed in the left navigation menu depend on your user permissions.

### Home {#user-interface-home}

This screen includes key links and resources for a quick access to the main Campaign v8 Web features. 

The **Recents** list provides shortcuts to the recently created and modified deliveries. This list shows their channel, status, owner, creation and modification dates.

The **Key performance indicators** lets you check your platform effectiveness through common KPIs. 

Access Campaign v8 Web key help pages from the **Learning** section of the home page.


### Key performance indicators {#user-interface-key-indicators}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="acw_keyindicators_spam"
>title="Spam"
>abstract="Spam KPI"

Browse to the home page to check key performance indicators for your platform. These indicators show the number and percentage of messages delivered, opened, clicked, unsubscription, and error rates.

Metrics are calculated for deliveries sent over the previous 7 days by default. You can change the period from the drop-down list on the upper right section of the card. Messages sent to test profiles are excluded.

You can select the channel to display. By default, these indicators reflect metrics for the email channel.

![](assets/kpi.png)

#### Message delivered {#ui-delivered-kpi} 

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="acw_keyindicators_delivered"
>title="Delivered"
>abstract="This metric shows, for the selected channel, the sum of all messages processed with success, and the percentage of message delivered with success compared to the total number of messages sent."

The number of messages delivered reflects your deliverability rate. It can never be 100% for the following reasons: some addresses or phone numbers can be wrong, spam blockers at emails providers may reject your messages, or deliverability issues can happen.

The **Delivered** indicator shows the following KPIs, for each channel:

* Percentage of the number of message delivered with success compared to the total number of messages sent.

* Sum of all messages processed with success.

In Adobe Campaign, the rule to mark a message as 'Delivered' is:

Count of messages for which the "seed address" field equals "No" and with a status equal to "Taken into account by the service provider" (for SMS) or "Sent" (for Emails) or "Received on the mobile" (for Push notifications).


#### Total opens {#ui-open-kpi} 

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="acw_keyindicators_opens"
>title="Opens"
>abstract="This metric shows, for the selected channel, the sum of all messages opened, and the percentage of message opened compared to the total number of messages delivered with success."

Total opens are calculated by tracking the total number of times a message is opened, regardless of how many individual recipients those opens are generated by. This indicator is only available for emails.

The **Opens** indicator shows the following KPIs, for each channel:

* Percentage of the number of message opened compared to the total number of messages delivered with success.

* Sum of all messages opened, per channel.

Adobe Campaign detects message opens when the recipient downloads the images in the email. HTML and Multipart/Alternative emails include a 0 pixel image, which enable you to detect messages which have been opened. Since messages in text format do not include any images, it is impossible to detect whether they have been opened or not. Values calculated based on message opens are always estimates, due to the error margin linked to image display.



#### Click-through rate {#ui-click-kpi} 

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="acw_keyindicators_clicks"
>title="Clicks"
>abstract="This metric shows, for the selected channel, the sum of all URL clicked in messages, and the percentage of clicks compared to the total number of messages delivered with success."

You can add URLs in your message content, which redirects recipients to a particular page. The Click-through rate measures the number and percentage of recipients who clicked on a link in the message.

The **Clicks** indicator shows the following KPIs, for each channel:

* Percentage of the number of clicks compared to the total number of messages delivered with success. 

* Number of distinct people having clicked at least once in a delivery. Unsubscription links and links to email mirror page are excluded.

This metrics are based on the Consolidated tracking table (`nms:trackingStats`). This aggregate table is used for performance reasons when displaying reports, in the place of the Recipient tracking logs table (`nms:trackingLogRcp`) and it is not calculated in real-time. The table is generated a few minutes after the tracking logs are retrieved.


#### Unsubscription rates {#ui-unsub-kpi} 

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="acw_keyindicators_unsubscriptions"
>title="Unsubscriptions"
>abstract="This metric shows, for the selected channel, the sum of all unsubscriptions from a service, and the percentage of unsubscriptions compared to the total number of messages delivered with success."

Recipients must be able to opt-out from Email and SMS through a dedicated unsubscription link in the email content, or by replying STOP to a SMS.

The **Unsubscriptions** indicator shows the following KPIs, for each channel:

* Percentage of the number of unsubscriptions compared to the total number of messages delivered with success.

* Sum of all clicks to an unsubscription link, i.e. with a URL category equals to "Opt-out".


#### Error rates {#ui-error-kpi} 

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="acw_keyindicators_errors"
>title="Errors"
>abstract="Total number of errors cumulated during deliveries and automatic bounce processing. The associated rate is the ratio with the number of messages to be delivered."

Some messages sent by your Adobe Campaign platform might not reach their destination. It can happen when the user address or phone has typos, or if the recipient changed their email address, or if their mailbox is full. If a message cannot be sent to a profile, the remote server automatically sends an error message to Adobe Campaign. This error is qualified to determine whether the email address, phone number or device should be quarantined.

As a consequence, you should always check and update your database, and make sure all profiles are active and real. Delivery errors can be temporary or permanent - soft or hard bounce - depending why the message was not delivered.

The **Errors** indicator shows the following KPIs, for each channel:

* Percentage of the number of errors compared to the total number of messages to be delivered.

* Total number of errors cumulated during deliveries and automatic rebound processing. 


### Explorer {#user-interface-explorer} 

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="acw_explorer"
>title="Explorer"
>abstract="The **Explorer** menu displays all Campaign components and objects with the same folder hierarchy as the one in the client console. Browse all your Campaign v8 components, folders and schemas, and create deliveries, workflows and campaigns. All other lists are read-only."

The **Explorer** menu displays all Campaign resources and objects with the same folder hierarchy as the one in the client console. Browse all your Campaign v8 components, folders and schemas, and create deliveries, workflows and campaigns. All other lists are read-only.

The items displayed in the Explorer depend on your user permissions. 

Like in any list screen, you can configure columns to personalize the display to view all the information you need. See this [section](#list-screens).
