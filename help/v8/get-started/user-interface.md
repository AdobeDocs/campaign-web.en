## Left navigation menu {#user-interface-left-nav}

Browse the links on the left to access Campaign v8 Web capabilities. Several links display lists of objects which can be sorted and filtered. You can also configure columns to display all the information you need. See this [section](#list-screens). All list screens are read-only, except the email delivery list. Clicking on any list item for edition/viewing is not available in Alpha. All lists will be editable in future versions. The items displayed in the left navigation menu depend on your user permissions.
