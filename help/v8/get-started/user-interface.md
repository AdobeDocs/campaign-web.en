>This documentation is frequently updated to reflect latest changes in the product user interface. However, some screenshots can slightly differ from your user interface.


## Left navigation menu {#user-interface-left-nav}

Browse the links on the left to access Campaign v8 Web capabilities. Several links display lists of objects which can be sorted and filtered. You can also configure columns to display all the information you need. See this [section](#list-screens). Some list screens are read-only. The items displayed in the left navigation menu and in the lists depend on your user permissions. Learn more about permissions in [this section](permissions.md).

The **Key performance indicators** lets you check your platform effectiveness through common KPIs. Learn more about these KPIs in [this page](../reporting/kpis.md).
