## Interface overview

![](assets/home.png)

The new Campaign v8 web interface offers an integrated, intuitive and consistent user experience.

Key concepts when browsing the user interface are common with Adobe Experience Platform. Refer to [Adobe Experience Platform documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/platform-ui/ui-guide.html#adobe-experience-platform-ui-guide) for more details.

The **Explorer** menu diaplays the same folder hierarchy as the one in the client console. Browse all your Campaign v8 components, folders and schemas. For the moment, all lists are read-only, except the delivery list. 

The items displayed in the explore depend on your user permissions. 

Like in any list screen, you can configure columns to display all the information you need. 

<!--
Explorer' menu in web UI to navigate through console content: console navtree second view in addition to the left menu lists with filters. The Explorer gives the real folder hierarchy from the console. Make sure you find your deliveries in sub-folders. All lists can be accessed in read-only. No Create/Edit. You can configure lists (colums). All schema fields, linked tables are available. 

If you need to view your lists of recipients (age, gender), transactions or live transactional messages. To view each/edit -> console.

Navtree view depends on permissions (same as console).
