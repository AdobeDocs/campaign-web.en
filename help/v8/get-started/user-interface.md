# Discover the interface {#user-interface}

The new Campaign v8 Web interface offers a modern and intuitive user experience to simplify marketing campaign design and delivery. This new interface is integrated with Adobe Experience Cloud apps and solutions. 


>[!NOTE]
>
>This documentation is frequently updated to reflect latest changes in the product user interface. However, some screenshots can slightly differ from your user interface.


## Left navigation menu {#user-interface-left-nav}

Browse the links on the left to access Campaign v8 Web capabilities. Several links display lists of objects which can be sorted and filtered. You can also configure columns to display all the information you need. See this [section](#list-screens). Some list screens are read-only. The items displayed in the left navigation menu and in the lists depend on your user permissions. Learn more about permissions in [this section](permissions.md).

### Campaign Management {#user-interface-campaign-management}

In the CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT section, you can access marketing campaigns, deliveries, and workflows.

* **Campaigns** - This is the list of your campaigns, and campaign templates. By default, for each campaign you can view the start/end/creation/last modification dates, the current status, and the name of the Campaign operator who created it. You can filter the list by status, start/end dates, folder, or create an advanced filter to define your own filtering criteria. Learn more about campaigns [in this section](../campaigns/gs-campaigns.md).

* **Deliveries** - Browse through your list of deliveries. By default, you can view their state, last modification date as well as key KPIs. You can filter the list by status, contact date or channel. Click an email delivery to open its dashboard to get an overview of the delivery details. Deliveries on other channels are read-only. Learn more about deliveries [in this section](../msg/gs-messages.md).

    Use the **More actions** button to delete or duplicate a delivery.

In addition, you can filter workflows which belong to a campaign, or not. Learn more about workflows [in this section](../workflows/gs-workflows.md).


### Customer Management {#user-interface-customer-management}
