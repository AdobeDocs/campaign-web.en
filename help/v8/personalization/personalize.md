## Personalize your emails {#personalize-emails}

When you create an email, you can add personalization in the **[!UICONTROL Subject line]** field of the message.

In the Email designer, you can personalize the content:

* In the **message**: click inside a text block, click the **Personalize** icon from the contextual toolbar and select **Insert personalization** field.

## Personalize your offers {#personalize-offers}

You can also access the personalization editor when adding text-type content to your offers' representations.

## Create personalized URLs{#personalize-urls}

Personalized URLs take recipients to specific pages of a website, or to a personalized microsite, depending on the profile attributes. In Adobe Journey Optimizer, you can add personalization to URLs in your message content. URL personalization can be applied to text and images, and use profile data or contextual data.
