Conditional content is a powerful feature that allows you to create dynamic personalization based on the recipient's profile, automatically replacing text blocks and images when certain conditions are met. This feature can take your campaigns to new heights and deliver highly targeted, personalized experiences to your audience.

By configuring conditional content fields, you can create advanced dynamic personalization based on the recipientâ€™s profile for example. Text blocks, links, subject line, and/or images are replaced in the message content when a particular condition is satisfied. For example, you can display 'Mr' or 'Mrs' according to the value of the Gender field in Adobe Campaign database, or include a different link based on the recipient preferred language.
