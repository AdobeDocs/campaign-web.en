# Get started with reports {#get-started-reports}

Our comprehensive suite of reporting tools provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of your marketing efforts, allowing you to optimize your campaigns for maximum impact. From delivery rates to open and click-through rates, our reporting suite has everything you need to make data-driven decisions that drive results.â€‹

Adobe Campaign offers two different reports:

* **Delivery reports**: The **Delivery reports** offer comprehensive insights and data specific to each channel. These reports provide detailed information on the performance, effectiveness, and outcomes of your individual deliveries, providing you with a comprehensive overview.

* **Campaign reports**: The **Campaign reports** provide a comprehensive overview of your campaign, incorporating all pertinent information regarding the different deliveries included. These reports offer a thorough analysis of each delivery's performance, per channel: success rates, audience engagement, and other essential metrics. They allow you to evaluate the overall effectiveness and impact of your campaign.
