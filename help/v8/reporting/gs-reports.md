# Get started with reports {#get-started-reports}

Our comprehensive suite of reporting tools provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of your marketing efforts, allowing you to optimize your campaigns for maximum impact. From delivery rates to open and click-through rates, our reporting suite has everything you need to make data-driven decisions that drive results.â€‹

Adobe Campaign offers three different reports:

* **Delivery reports**
    
    The **Delivery reports** provide in-depth insights and data exclusively focused on your **deliveries** across each channel. These reports provide detailed information on the performance, effectiveness, and outcomes of your individual deliveries, providing you with a comprehensive overview.


* **Campaign reports**

    The **Campaign reports** provide a comprehensive overview of your **campaign**, incorporating all pertinent information regarding the different deliveries included. These reports offer a thorough analysis of each delivery's performance, per channel: success rates, audience engagement, and other essential metrics. They allow you to evaluate the overall effectiveness and impact of your campaign. 


* **Global reports**

    The **Global reports** serve as an effective tool, offering a consolidated overall summary of traffic and engagement metrics for each channel within your Campaign instance. These reports consist of various widgets, each offering a distinct perspective on your campaign or delivery performance.
