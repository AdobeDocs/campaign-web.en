The **Campaign reports** provide a comprehensive overview of your **campaign**, incorporating all pertinent information regarding the different deliveries included. These reports offer a thorough analysis of each delivery's performance, per channel: success rates, audience engagement, and other essential metrics. They allow you to evaluate the overall effectiveness and impact of your campaign. 

The full list of reports and associated metrics for each channel is available in the following pages:

* [Email campaign channel](campaign-reports-email.md)
