The **Global reports** serve as an effective tool, offering a consolidated overall summary of traffic and engagement metrics for each channel within your Campaign instance. These reports consist of various widgets, each offering a distinct perspective on your campaign or delivery performance.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are refreshed hourly, ensuring up-to-date insights. By default, data is filtered to cover the past 30 days, offering a current and relevant perspective on your campaigns and deliveries performance.

The full list of reports and associated metrics for each channel is available in the following pages:

* [Email global reports](global-report-email.md)
* [SMS global reports](global-report-sms.md)
* [Push global reports](global-report-push.md)
* [Direct mail global reports](global-report-direct.md)
