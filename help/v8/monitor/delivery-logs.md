Once the delivery is prepared and you click the **Send** button, browse to the delivery logs to check the warnings, errors, status, exclusions, and tracking data. These logs can be accessed directly from the message dashboard. They show the detail of the sending, which target has been excluded and why, as well as the tracking information such as opens and clicks.

To view the logs, access your delivery dashboard and click the **Logs** button.

The following tabs are available:

* [Logs](#logs-tab)
* [Deliveries](#deliveries-tab)
* [Exclusions](#exclusion-tab)
* [Exclusion causes](#exclusion-causes)
* [Tracked URLs](#tracked-urls)
* [Tracking](#tracking)

## Logs {#logs-tab}

The **Logs** tab contains all messages relating to the delivery and the proofs. Specific icons allow you to identify errors or warnings. 

All the validation steps, warnings, and errors are listed. Colored icons show the message type:

* The grey icon indicates an informative message.
* The yellow icon indicates a non-critical processing error.
* The red icon indicates a critical error that prevents sending the delivery. Critical errors must be fixed for the delivery to be sent.
