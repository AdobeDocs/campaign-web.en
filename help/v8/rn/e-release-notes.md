# Early release notes {#e-release}

Adobe Campaign Web User interface continuously delivers new features, enhancements to existing features, and bug fixes. All changes are consolidated at the end of each month in the [release notes](release-notes.md). 

**Early release notes below are subject to change without prior notice until the release availability date**. Links, screens and updated documentation are published in the [release notes](release-notes.md), at the release date.

## July release notes {#24-7-release}

**Release date**: July 30-31, 2024

The following features and improvements are available starting July release.

### Expression fragments {#24-7-1}

You can now author, use, and manage **expression fragments** to quickly build personalized content. A fragment is a prebuilt reusable component that can be referenced in multiple contents across Adobe Campaign for an improved and accelerated design process.

### Seed lists {#24-7-2}

A seed list, aka. **Trap group**, is a list of seed addresses. It is used to include specific addresses in your deliveries, and then target profiles who do not match the defined target criteria. This way, recipients who are out of the delivery audience can receive the delivery, as any other target recipient would. You can use seed addresses when sending proofs, or to protect your mailing list.

### Rich push notification templates {#24-7.3}

You can now send rich push notifications. A rich push notification is an enhanced form of mobile notification that goes beyond simple text messages by incorporating multimedia elements such as images, interactive buttons, or other rich media content. With this version, a set of templates for rich push notifications are now available for your iOS and Android apps.
