# Early release notes {#e-release}

Adobe Campaign Web User interface continuously delivers new features, enhancements to existing features, and bug fixes. All changes are consolidated at the end of each month in the [release notes](release-notes.md). 

**Early release notes below are subject to change without prior notice until the release availability date**. Links, screens and updated documentation are published in the [release notes](release-notes.md), at the release date.

## August release notes {#24-8-release}

**Release date**: Sept 3, 2024

The following features and improvements are available starting August release.

* **Distribution of values** - When accessing the list of fields for personalization, you can now check how values are distributed for each field. A dedicated popup window shows the number and percentage for each value.

* **Landing pages captcha** - You can now add captcha to protect your landing page from spam and abuse caused by bots. This is non-intrusive for your customers since it does not require any interaction from them and is based on interactions with your site.
