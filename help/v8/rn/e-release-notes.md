<p>You can now create typologies and typology rules in Adobe Campaign Web User Interface. Typologies let you control, filter, and prioritize the sending of deliveries. Typologies validate that deliveries always contain mandatory components (such as an unsubscription link or a subject line) or filtering rules to exclude groups from your audience (like unsubscribers, competitors, or non-loyalty customers).</p>
