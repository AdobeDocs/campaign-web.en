### Seed lists {#24-6-2}

A seed list, aka. **Trap group**, is a list of seed addresses. It is used to include specific addresses in your deliveries, and then target profiles who do not match the defined target criteria. This way, recipients who are out of the delivery audience can receive the delivery, as any other target recipient would. You can use seed addresses when sending proofs, or to protect your mailing list.

### Delivery alerting {#24-6-3}

The Delivery alerting feature is an alert management system that enables a group of users to automatically receive notifications containing information on the execution of their deliveries.    

### Plans and programs {#24-6-4}
