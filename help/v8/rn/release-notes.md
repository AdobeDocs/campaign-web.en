## June '25 release {#25-6-release} 

### Improvements {#25-6-improvements}

* The Delivery Summary report is now available for both Call Center and Custom channels.

* When configuring an SMS delivery, you now have access to the specific SMS parameters. These are the same parameters available in the Client Console.

* Your favorite folders now appear at the top of the left panel on the Explorer page, making them easier to access.

* The Rule Builder now supports drag-and-drop, allowing you to rearrange components of your query more efficiently.

* The "human condition" in the Rule Builder has been improved. This is the written, plain-language version of your rules, displayed at the bottom of the screen:

	* Attributes are now highlighted and the associated schema is displayed.
	* You can click on these elements to view more detailed information.
	* You can now copy the human condition using the corresponding button.

* Access to the folders "Technical workflows" and "Objects created automatically" is now restricted to prevent them from being viewed.
