## August release notes {#24-8-release}

**Release date**: Sept 3, 2024

The following features and improvements are available starting August release.

* **External delivery** -  You can now define External deliveries, and External delivery templates, in Campaign web user interface.

* **Visual fragments** - You can now archive visual content fragments.

* **Distribution of values** - When accessing the list of fields for personalization, you can now check how values are distributed for each field. A dedicated popup window shows the number and percentage for each value.
