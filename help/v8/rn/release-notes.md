* **Multilingual delivery creation** - You can now send multiple email deliveries in different languages in Adobe Campaign Web User Interface. The Multilingual delivery feature allows you to choose the default language of your delivery as well as the different languages in which the delivery can be sent.

-->

* **Delivery alerting** - The Delivery alerting feature is an alert management system that enables a group of users to automatically receive notifications containing information on the execution of their deliveries. [Read more](../msg/delivery-alerting.md)

* **Landing pages improvements** - The following improvements to landing pages are now available:

    * You can now reference a default subscription/unsubscription landing page when configuring a service. When designing an email, if you define a link to that landing page, users submitting the landing page form are automatically subscribed to or unsubscribed from this service. [Read more](../audience/manage-services.md#create-service)
    * A new option in the landing page configuration allows anonymous visitors to access the landing page. If you unselect this option, only identified users can access and submit the form. [Read more](../landing-pages/create-lp.md#create-landing-page)
    * A new option in the landing page configuration allows to store additional internal data when the landing page is being submitted. [Read more](../landing-pages/create-lp.md#create-landing-page)
    * A new option enables to use a landing page for several services, making it dynamic. When adding a link to an email, if you select a dynamic landing page, you can select any service. If you select a landing page that has a specific service associated, this service will be automatically used (you cannot select another one). [Read more](../landing-pages/create-lp.md#define-actions-on-form-submission)
    * Conditional content is now supported in landing pages. [Read more](../landing-pages/lp-content.md)
    * You can link a landing page to a service, and send a confirmation message when users validate it. [Learn more](../landing-pages/lp-content.md#lp-message)
    * You can add captcha to protect your landing page from spam and abuse caused by bots. This is non-intrusive for your customers since it does not require any interaction from them and is based on interactions with your site. [Learn more](../landing-pages/create-lp.md#captcha)

Previously released in Limited Availability, the following capability is now available **on demand**:

* **Dynamic Reporting** - You can now access Dynamic Reporting which provides fully customizable and real-time reports to measure the impact of your marketing activities. It adds access to profile data, enabling demographic analysis by profile dimensions such as gender, city and age in addition to functional email campaign data like opens and clicks. Dynamic reporting is also available for multilingual email deliveries and transactional messages. [Read more](../reporting/dynamic-reporting/get-started-reporting.md)

* **Centralized Branding** -  Your technical administrators can now define one or several brands to centralize the parameters that affect a brand's identity. This includes the brand logo, the domain of the landing pages' access URL, or message tracking settings. You can create these brands and link them to messages or landing pages. This configuration is managed in templates. Branding options are available for all channels, including SMS and Direct mail. [Read more](../administration/branding/branding-gs.md){target="_blank"}
