Adobe Campaign Web user interface releases operate on a continuous delivery model which allows for a more scalable, phased approach to feature deployment. Accordingly, these release notes get updated several times a month. Please check them regularly.

Changes and improvements available with previous releases are listed in the [2024](release-notes-24.md) and [2025](release-notes-25.md) pages.

## September '25 updates {#25-9-updates} 

The following improvement has been released:

* A set of new operators has been added when setting up a condition using the Email Designerâ€™s conditional content capability.

## August '25 release {#25-8-release} 

This release comes with a series of bug fixes, including:

* The profile duplication process has been improved to match the Client Console behavior, ensuring a consistent experience across both interfaces. This fixes an issue which could prevent the duplicated profiles from being created.

* The **[!UICONTROL Email BCC]** option, in the delivery configuration screen, now works with Momentum (Enhanced MTA). This functionality was previously only available in the Client Console.
