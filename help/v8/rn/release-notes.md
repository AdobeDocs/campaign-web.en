<p>You can now use a delivery scheduling compute process similar to the one available in Adobe Campaign Standard. This feature allows you to calculate sending dates based on recipient timezones, enabling you to send communications at the optimal time for each recipient. This is particularly useful for organizations operating across multiple timezones, as it allows you to target regions with different timezones using a single delivery configuration.</p>
