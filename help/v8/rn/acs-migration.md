<!--
* Delivery Alerting: In addition to viewing notifications directly in Campaign, Adobe Campaign also provides an email alerting system to trigger email alerts to users or external stakeholders of important system activities. Create, manage, and receive customizable alerts and dashboards to keep track of delivery successes or failures. Adobe Campaign Delivery Alerting boosts efficiency by keeping all involved Adobe Campaign users in a company automatically informed about the delivery execution status, via email and dashboard. 

* Landing Pages: Landing pages are web forms that can be used to capture information on your audiences, offer subscriptions to a service, display data and grow your database. Landing pages can also be used for acquiring or updating existing profiles, and to set up a double opt-in mechanism, allowing you to protect the platform from wrong or invalid email addresses, or spambots.
