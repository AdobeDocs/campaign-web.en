Adobe Campaign allows you to create, design, and share landing pages. In the context of marketing campaigns, a landing page is a standalone web page where a visitor is directed after they click on a link in an email, SMS, or push delivery, or a website. 

[!DNL Adobe Campaign] allows you to create and design landing pages to direct your users to online forms where they can opt-in/out from receiving your communications, or subscribe to a specific service such as a newsletter. Adobe Campaign comes with four templates to manage acquisition, subscriptions, unsubscriptions, and denylist use cases.

Key capabilities are listed below:

* Leverage [!DNL Adobe Campaign] content design capabilities to easily build **responsive landing pages**.
* Set up **opt-in and opt-out flows** quickly and seamlessly.
* Create subscription services to enable users to **subscribe to a service**. [Learn more](../audience/manage-services.md)
* Provide your recipients with the **capability to unsubscribe** from receiving your communications.
<!--Send a **confirmation email** upon opt-in or opt-out.-->
