# Get started with landing pages {#get-sarted-lp}

A landing page is a standalone web page that a user is directed to after clicking through from an email, a website, an ad, or any other digital location.

[!DNL Adobe Campaign] allows you to create and design landing pages to direct your users to online forms where they can opt in or opt out from receiving your communications, or subscribe to a specific service such as a newsletter.

* Leverage [!DNL Adobe Campaign] content design capabilities to easily build **responsive landing pages**.
* Set up **opt-in and opt-out flows** quickly and seamlessly.
* Create subscription services to enable users to **subscribe to a service**.
* Provide your recipients with the **capability to unsubscribe** from receiving your communications.
* Send a **confirmation email** upon opt-in or opt-out.
