[!DNL Adobe Campaign] allows you to create, design, and share landing pages.

In the context of marketing campaigns, a landing page is a standalone web page where a visitor is directed after they click a link in an delivery or on a website. 

Landing pages enable you to direct your users to online forms where they can update their data, opt-in/out from receiving your communications, or subscribe to a specific service such as a newsletter.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Landing pages that you create in the Campaign Web user interface are different from the web forms created from the client console. You cannot display or edit web forms created in the client console in the Campaign Web user interface.

>Learn more on web forms in the [Campaign v8 (console) documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/content/webapps.html){target="_blank"}.
