A preheader is a short text that follows the subject line when viewing an email from any major email client.

In many cases, it provides a short summary of the content, and is typically one sentence long.

>Preheaders are not supported by all email clients. When not supported, the preheader does not display.

To define the email preheader, follow the steps below.

1. From the [Email Designer](create-email-content.md), add at least a **[!UICONTROL Structure]** component to start designing your email.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Navigation tree]** icon from the left pane, and select **[!UICONTROL Body]**.
