1. Start designing your email content by drag and dropping **[!UICONTROL Structures]** into the canvas to define the layout of your email.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Stacking columns is not compatible with all email programs. When not supported, columns are not stacked.

1. Add as many **[!UICONTROL Structures]** as needed and edit their settings in the dedicated pane on the right.

1. You can select the **[!UICONTROL n:n column]** component to define the number of columns of your choice (between 3 and 10). You can also define the width of each column by moving the arrows at the bottom of each column.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Each column size cannot be under 10% of the total width of the structure component. You cannot remove a column that is not empty.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Components]** section, drag and drop as many elements as you need into one or more structures. [Learn more about content components](content-components.md)

1. Each component can be further customized using the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** or **[!UICONTROL Style]** tabs on the right. For example, you can change the text style, padding or margin of each component. [Learn more about alignment and padding](alignment-and-padding.md)
