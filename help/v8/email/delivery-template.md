# Work with delivery template{#work-with-delivery-template}

Use delivery templates to standardize the creative look and feel, in order to be quicker in executing and launching campaigns.

A template can include:

* Typologies
* Sender and reply-to addresses
* Basic personalization blocks
* Links to mirror page and unsubscription links
* Content, company logo, or signature
* Other delivery properties, such as resource validity, retry parameters, or quarantine settings.


## Create a template{#create-a-delivery-template}

To create a delivery template, you can duplicate a built-in template, convert an existing delivery into a template or create a delivery template from scratch.

### Duplicate an existing template{#copy-an-existing-template}

Campaign comes with a set of built-in templates for each channel: email, push, SMS.

The easiest way to create a delivery template is to duplicate and customize a built-in template.

To duplicate a delivery template, follow the steps below:

1. Browse to the **Templates** tab, from the **Deliveries** left menu.
1. Click the three dots button on the right, next to the name of the template to duplicate.
1. Select  **[!UICONTROL Duplicate]**.
1. Confirm duplication: the new template dashboard opens in the central screen.
1. Define the template settings and save the new template.

The template is added to the list of delivery templates. You can now select it when creating a new delivery.

### Convert an existing delivery to a template {#convert-an-existing-delivery}

Any delivery can be converted to a template for new repeated delivery actions. 

To convert a delivery to a template, follow the steps below:

1. Click the three dots button on the right, next to the name of the delivery to save as a template.
1. Select  **[!UICONTROL Copy as a template]**.
1. Confirm duplication: the new template opens in the central screen.

### Create a new template {#create-a-new-template}

1. Click the  **[!UICONTROL Create template]** button.
1. Select the channel for the template.
1. Define the template name and settings.
