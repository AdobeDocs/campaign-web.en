## Guardrails and limitations {#generative-guardrails}

General guidelines for using AI Assistant in Adobe Campaign Web for email generation are listed below:

* The quality of the generated content depends heavily on the marketing objective or prompt you define. Use a well-defined prompt for the GenAI model to interpret accurately.  
* Upload brand assets to ensure accurate, on-brand content. Otherwise, content is based on publicly available information. The uploaded content can be in the following formats: PDF, JPEG, PNG, or ZIP files (with supported file formats).  
* The maximum size for uploaded brand assets is 50MB. Larger files or numerous images may increase processing time.  
* Use [built-in email templates](../content/create-email-templates.md), brand-specific templates, or custom templates to create your email content using AI Assistant. Email templates with up to 8â€“10 images are recommended.  
* Report any problematic outputs using the thumbs-up, thumbs-down, or flag icons when selecting variants.  
* Your use of AI Assistant is subject to the Adobe Experience Cloud Generative AI User Guidelines. [Learn more](https://www.adobe.com/legal/licenses-terms/adobe-dx-gen-ai-user-guidelines.html).  
* As part of Adobe's commitment to transparency in the use of generative AI tools in media creation, Adobe applies Content Credentials when content or a project that includes a Firefly-generated asset is downloaded or exported. [Learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/firefly/using/content-credentials.html).  

The following limitations apply to AI Assistant in Adobe Campaign Web:

* AI Assistant in Adobe Campaign Web is currently supported in English only. Non-English inputs may produce inconsistent or erroneous results. Issues arising from non-English responses will not be addressed or improved at this time.  
* Only available for the email, push, and SMS channels.  
* GenAI content might not always be accurate. Share your feedback so engineers can refine the models.  
* You may upload multiple brand assets but can leverage only one for a specific generation.
