# Get started with messages in Campaign Web {#gs-messages}

With Adobe Campaign, you can send cross-channel campaigns including emails, SMS, and Push notifications, and measure their effectiveness using various dedicated reports. These messages are designed and sent though deliveries, and can be personalized for each recipient. These deliveries can be standalone or included in the context of a marketing campaign.

Adobe Campaign v8 comes with the following delivery channels:

* **Email channel**: email deliveries let you send personalized emails to the target population. Learn how to create and send an email in [this page](../email/create-email.md).

* **SMS channel**: deliveries on mobile channels let you send personalized SMS to the target population.  Learn how to create and send SMS in [this page](../sms/create-sms.md).

* **Mobile application channel**: mobile app deliveries let you send notifications to iOS and Android systems.  Learn how to create and send push notifications in [this page](../push/gs-push.md).

## Add personalization{#personalization}

Messages delivered by Adobe Campaign can be personalized in various ways. [Learn more about personalization capabilities](../personalization/personalize.md).

Use Campaign to create dynamic content and send personalized messages. Personalization capabilities can be combined to improve your messages and create a custom user experience.

You can personalize the message content by:

* Inserting dynamic **personalization fields**

    Personalization fields are used for first-level personalization of your messages. You can select any field available in the database from the personalization editor. For a delivery, you can select any field related to the recipient, the message or the delivery. These personalization attributes can be inserted in the subject line or the body of your messages. [Learn more](../personalization/personalize.md)
    
* Inserting pre-defined **content blocks**
    
    Campaign comes with a set of personalization blocks which contain a specific rendering that you can insert into your deliveries. For example, you can add a logo, a greeting message, or a link to the mirror page of the message. Content blocks are available from a dedicated entry un the personalization editor. [Learn more](../personalization/personalize.md#ootb-content-blocks)

* Create **conditional content**

    Configure conditional content to add dynamic personalization based on the recipientâ€™s profile for example. Text blocks and/or images are inserted when a particular condition is true. [Learn more](../personalization/conditions.md)

* Add **personalized offers**
    
    Insert personalized offers in your message content, depending on the recipient location, the current weather, or the last purchase order.


## Preview and test your deliveries

Once your message content has been defined, you can preview it to control the rendering of your messages, and check personalization settings with test profiles. [Learn more](../preview-test/preview-test.md)
