# Mirror page {#mirror-page}

The mirror page is an online version of your email. Adding a link to the mirror page is a good practice in email marketing. Users can access the mirror page of an email, for example, if they experience rendering issues or broken images when viewing it in their inbox. Providing an online version is also recommended for accessibility reasons or to encourage social sharing.

The mirror page generated by Adobe Campaign includes all personalization data.

## Add a link to the mirror page {#link-to-mirror-page}

In Adobe Campaign, insert a link to the mirror page in the email content using the dedicated **personalization block**. The built-in **Link to mirror page** personalization block inserts the following code in your email content: `<%@ include view='MirrorPage' %>`.

To add a link to a mirror page in your email, follow these steps:

1. Select an element (text or image), and click **[!UICONTROL Insert link]** from the contextual toolbar.

The mirror page is automatically created.

When the email is sent, recipients who click the mirror page link see the email content displayed in their default web browser.

By default, the retention period for a mirror page is **60 days**. After this period, the mirror page is no longer available.

>* Mirror page links are auto-generated and cannot be edited. They include all the encrypted personalized data required to render the original email. Using personalized attributes with large values may generate lengthy mirror page URLs, which can prevent the link from working in web browsers with a maximum URL length.

>* In the proof sent to test profiles, the link to the mirror page is not active. It is only active in the final messages.

## Mirror page generation {#mirror-page-generation}

By default, Adobe Campaign automatically generates the mirror page if the email content is not empty and contains a link to the mirror page (also known as a Mirror link).

Control the generation mode of the email mirror page through options available in the delivery properties. [Learn more](../advanced-settings/delivery-settings.md#mirror)
