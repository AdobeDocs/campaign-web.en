# Mirror page {#mirror-page}

The mirror page is an online version of your email. Adding a link to the mirror page is an email marketing good practice. Users can browse to the mirror page of an email, for example if they are experiencing rendering issues or broken images when trying to view it in their inbox. It is also recommended to provide an online version for accessibility reasons, or to encourage social sharing.

The mirror page generated by Adobe Campaign contains all personalization data.

## Add a link to the mirror page{#link-to-mirror-page}

In Adobe Campaign, you can insert a link to the mirror page in the email content using the dedicated **personalization block**. The built-in **Link to mirror page** personalization block inserts the following code in your email content: `<%@ include view='MirrorPage' %>`.

To add a link to a mirror page in your email, follow these steps:

1. Select an element (text or image) and click **[!UICONTROL Insert link]** from the contextual toolbar.

The mirror page is automatically created.

Once the email is sent, when the recipients click the mirror page link, the content of the email is displayed in their default web browser.

By default, the retention period for a mirror page is **60 days**. After that delay, the mirror page is no longer available.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>* Mirror pages links are auto-generated and cannot be edited. They contain all the encrypted personalized data that is required to render the original email. As a result, using personalised attributes with large values may generate lengthy mirror pages URLs, which can prevent the link from working in web browsers that have a maximum URLs length.

>* In the proof sent to the test profiles, the link to the mirror page is not active. It is only active in the final messages.


## Mirror page generation {#mirror-page-generation}

By default, the mirror page is automatically generated by Adobe Campaign if the email content is not empty, and if it contains a link to the mirror page (aka Mirror link).

You can control the generation mode of the email mirror page. Options are available in the delivery properties. [Learn more](../advanced-settings/delivery-settings.md#mirror)
