Transactional messaging is a specialized module in Adobe Campaign designed to handle triggered messages. These messages are generated automatically in response to events coming from information systems. Common examples of such events include clicking on buttons or links, cart abandonment, requesting product availability alerts, account creation, or modification.

Transactional messages are used to send: 

* Important notifications, such as order confirmations or password resets,
* Real-time responses to customer actions, such as account creation or purchase completion,
* Non-promotional content that is critical for customer interactions.

The Transactional Messaging module integrates seamlessly with your information systems. Events, such as customer actions, are pushed to Adobe Campaign, which sends the corresponding personalized message. These messages can be sent individually or in batches via various channels, such as email, SMS, or push notifications.

You can find the **[!UICONTROL Transactional message]** module in the **[!UICONTROL Triggered messages]** section.
