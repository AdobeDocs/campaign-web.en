# Validate transactional messages

During or after creating your transactional message, you may want to validate the content using a data sample.

Follow these steps to simulate and validate the content of your message : 

* Ensure that the personalization path in your message content matches your context sample. In the example below, to display the first name of the test profile, we use the path *rtEvent.ctx.basicDetails.firstName* 

    You can change the message content or the context sample to make them align.

* Click on the **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** button to preview your transactional message with the data you entered in the context sample.

    After checking your content, click on the **[!UICONTROL Close]** button.

* Do not forget to click **[!UICONTROL Republish]** button if you have made any changes to your content.
